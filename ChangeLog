	* gnome-inform7.glade: Changed the keyboard shortcuts and some of the
	menu items to be more like the Mac OS X version. Added a new menu item
	Window/Show Inspectors, which does nothing yet.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c: Removed the Window/Next Panel
	command.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c, tabgame.c: Removed the Game/Play
	command, which played a user-selected game file in the game tab.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c: Added a submenu of Window, Show
	Tabs, with menu items causing each notebook tab in the current pane to
	be activated.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c, compile.c: Removed the Game/Compile
	command and reused its code to implement the Game/Rebuild Index
	command.

	* Makefile.am: The OSSP UUID library is now called ossp-uuid, so as not
	to conflict with the e2fsprogs UUID library. The check to avoid the
	name conflict is no longer necessary.

	* prefs.c, tabsource.c, extwindow.c: Fixed the tab stops. Although
	gtk_text_view_set_tabs still does nothing, GtkSourceView provides a
	working function for tab stops.
	* gnome-inform7.glade: Changed the maximum of the tab stop slider
	to 32, because that's the maximum tab width that GtkSourceView can
	handle.

	* gnome-inform7.glade: Added tooltips to most elements in the
	preferences and new project dialogs.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, prefs.c, configfile.c: Changed "Index"
	inspector toggle to "Headings" as in the new OS X version. Added a
	slider for setting the tab stops, although tab stops are not
	implemented in the current version of Pango? Made a few cosmetic
	changes.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, gnome-inform7.gladep: Added menu
	items: File/Revert and Game/Rebuild Index. They do nothing so far.

	* configure.in, src/compile.c: Added a test to include <ossp/uuid.h>
	instead of <uuid.h> on appropriate systems.

	* data/*, **/Makefile.am: Updated files and makefiles for Build 3Z95 of
	Natural Inform.
	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Changed to follow conventions more closely.
	* Makefile.am, data/extensions/EmilyShort/Makefile.am, data/extensions/
    GrahamNelson/Makefile.am: Changed the install-data-local and uninstall-
	local targets in the top makefile, which renamed the filenames to their
	real names with spaces, to install-data-hook and uninstall-hook targets
	in the makefiles in the actual directories.
