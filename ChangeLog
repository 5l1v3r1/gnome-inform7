	* data/*, **/Makefile.am: Updated files and makefiles for Build 4K41 of
	Natural Inform.
    * inspector.c, gnome-inform7.glade: Added an extra "null inspector"
    appearing when all the other inspectors are switched off, so that the
    user isn't presented with an empty window.

Sat Jan 28 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* file.c: Fixed a bug where extension files beginning with 'Version X
	of ...' were not accepted as extensions.
	* story.c, extension.c, file.c: Added file monitoring, offering to
	reload source or extension files when they are modified by another
	program.

Wed Jan 24 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* tabindex.c: Optimized the functions for reloading the index tabs.

	time.

Mon Jan 22 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* compile.c, configfile.c, appwindow.c, tabgame.c, html.c, file.c,
	tabindex.c, newdialog.c: Replaced all instances of g_strconcat() being
	used to put together a path with g_build_filename(), as well as all
	explicit mentions of "/" as the directory separator.
	* tabindex.c: Some optimizations
	* main.c: Upped the required GLib version to 2.8, for
	g_mkdir_with_parents().

Sun Jan 21 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* prefs.c: Added drag-and-drop functionality to the list of Natural
	Inform extensions; now you can drag extensions there to install them.
	* file.c: is_valid_extension() does not crash anymore on binary files.
	* appwindow.c: "Open Recent" menu in the main application window now
	actually uses its filter.
	* appwindow.c, file.c, welcomedialog.c: Now GtkRecentManager saves the
	'story.ni' files with the project name as their display name, so that
	other applications can open them too, and since for some reason the
	GtkRecentChooserMenu doesn't display directories.
	* prefs.c: The "Remove" button would remain sensitive if there was one
	selected extension that was then deleted. Fixed this.

Sat Jan 20 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* file.c, windowlist.c, extwindow.c: Minor optimizations
	* findreplace.c, appwindow.c, extwindow.c: Removed the confusing

Tue Jan 16 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* inspector.c, appwindow.c, extwindow.c, story.c, extension.c, prefs.c:
	Now there is only one inspector window instead of a separate instance
	for each open document. Data in the inspectors refreshes whenever a
	main window receives a focus-in-event signal.
	* rtf.c, rtf.h: Added functions for reading/writing RTF files from
	GtkTextBuffers.
	* file.c: Now load and save the notes along with the project.

	* prefs.c, gnome-inform7.glade, inspector.c: Now the preferences to
	switch the individual inspectors on and off work.

Sun Dec 3 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* gnome-inform7.glade: Built the Inspectors window.

Sun Nov 26 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* appwindow.c, extwindow.c, findreplace.c, gnome-inform7.glade:
	Combined the Find and Replace windows into one streamlined version that
	is more like the Mac OS X version.
	* extwindow.c, gnome-inform7.glade: Added a File/Revert menu item to
	the extension editing window.
	* appwindow.c, extwindow.c: Added a check so that Revert does not work
	if the project has never been saved.
	* file.c: Fixed a bug so that "Reopen last project" from the welcome
	dialog does not try to open the last extension.

Sat Nov 25 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* file.c: When opening a project, if the index files exist in the
	project directory, they are loaded into the index tabs.
	* appwindow.c: Added the code for the File/Revert command which reloads
	the saved version from disk.
	* gnome-inform7.glade: changed the File/Revert menu item to use the
	stock icon.
	* file.c, story.c: If the "Delete build files" option is selected, the

	preferences window was opened.
	* gnome-inform7.glade: Removed remark from the tooltip of the "Delete
	build files" option saying that build files are not deleted if you
	close and discard changes.

Wed Nov 22 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* gnome-inform7.glade: Changed the keyboard shortcuts and some of the
	menu items to be more like the Mac OS X version. Added a new menu item
	Window/Show Inspectors, which does nothing yet.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c: Removed the Window/Next Panel
	command.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c, tabgame.c: Removed the Game/Play
	command, which played a user-selected game file in the game tab.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c: Added a submenu of Window, Show
	Tabs, with menu items causing each notebook tab in the current pane to
	be activated.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, appwindow.c, compile.c: Removed the Game/Compile
	command and reused its code to implement the Game/Rebuild Index
	command.

Tue Nov 21 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: The OSSP UUID library is now called ossp-uuid, so as not
	to conflict with the e2fsprogs UUID library. The check to avoid the
	name conflict is no longer necessary.

Sun Oct 22 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* prefs.c, tabsource.c, extwindow.c: Fixed the tab stops. Although
	gtk_text_view_set_tabs still does nothing, GtkSourceView provides a
	working function for tab stops.
	* gnome-inform7.glade: Changed the maximum of the tab stop slider
	to 32, because that's the maximum tab width that GtkSourceView can
	handle.

Sat Oct 21 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* gnome-inform7.glade: Added tooltips to most elements in the
	preferences and new project dialogs.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, prefs.c, configfile.c: Changed "Index"
	inspector toggle to "Headings" as in the new OS X version. Added a
	slider for setting the tab stops, although tab stops are not
	implemented in the current version of Pango? Made a few cosmetic
	changes.
	* gnome-inform7.glade, gnome-inform7.gladep: Added menu
	items: File/Revert and Game/Rebuild Index. They do nothing so far.

Wed Oct 4 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* configure.in, src/compile.c: Added a test to include <ossp/uuid.h>
	instead of <uuid.h> on appropriate systems.

Mon Sep 25 2006  P.F. Chimento  <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* data/*, **/Makefile.am: Updated files and makefiles for Build 3Z95 of
	Natural Inform.
	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Changed to follow conventions more closely.
	* Makefile.am, data/extensions/EmilyShort/Makefile.am, data/extensions/
    GrahamNelson/Makefile.am: Changed the install-data-local and uninstall-
	local targets in the top makefile, which renamed the filenames to their
	real names with spaces, to install-data-hook and uninstall-hook targets
	in the makefiles in the actual directories.

Sun Sep 24 2006  P.F. Chimento  <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* Release 0.1
