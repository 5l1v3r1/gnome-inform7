<p>
This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more information on other contributors.
<p>
<p>The improvements to the interface in this release have all been bug-fixes and improvements suggested (and sometimes contributed) by users. I would like to thank everyone who did so. There are many things going on under the hood for the next release: for one thing, the next version will make full use of the features of GTK+ 2.12. If everything goes well, it will also use a new library which I am collaborating on to provide full Glulx features in the Game tab and solve some of the problems of the embedded Gargoyle interpreter. 
<p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: If you are upgrading from version 5J39 or earlier, and you are having problems with extensions, you may have to delete your ~/Inform directory and reinstall your extensions.
<p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: From version 5G67 onward, the GNOME Inform 7 source package will not include the compiler binaries anymore. If you compile GNOME Inform 7 from source, you will need to download the appropriate package from <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org">www.inform-fiction.org</a> and put the appropriate versions of `ni',  `inform-6.31-biplatform', and `cBlorb' in the directory `gnome-inform7/data/Compilers' before doing `make install'. This is in the interests of having a truly platform-independent source package, and also of shaving a few megabytes off the size of the source package. The Fedora and Ubuntu packages will continue to include binaries.

<h4>To report bugs:</h4>
<p>If the bug is in the interface, the fastest way to report it is to e-mail it to me at <a href="mailto:philip.chimento@gmail.com">philip.chimento@gmail.com</a>. Other bugs, e.g. if your story is not compiling correctly, should be reported to Graham Nelson, the author of Inform. Use the <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Documents/BugReport.txt">bug report form</a> on the Inform 7 website.
