<body><font size=2><h3>GNOME Inform 7</h3>
<p>
<p>This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. Much of the code was borrowed from Andrew Hunter's Mac OS X version and David Kinder's Windows version.
<p>
<p>Version 0.2 of GNOME Inform 7 is the second release of this program. In August 2006, I started designing the user interface purely to kill some time. I then started actually writing it because I was surprised how easy it was. Also, it was a good excuse to learn GTK+. In this second version I have fixed some bugs, and added most features from the Mac OS X version that were missing before. Most importantly, it now runs the native Linux Inform 7 binaries compiled by Adam Thornton. Please help me by reporting bugs to &lt;<a href="mailto:philip.chimento@gmail.com">philip.chimento@gmail.com</a>&gt;.
<p>Also, there are some shortcomings which I suppose don't count as bugs, as I am aware of them and have left them to be addressed in a subsequent version (or not at all):
<ul>
<li>There is no Skein and no Transcript. (I hope to have ported these by version 0.4.)</li>
<li>The Replay command therefore doesn't replay through the skein; it just repeats the commands from the last time the game was played.</li>
<li>The syntax highlighting doesn't work quite the same way as in the OS X and Windows versions; I found it useful to highlight `if', `otherwise', `begin' and `end if' in another color. Also, nested comments are not highlighted correctly; this is a limitation of GtkSourceView.</li>
<li>On the Installed Extensions page, all the extensions will be listed as overridden by a locally installed version. This is a limitation of the compiler.</li>
</ul>
