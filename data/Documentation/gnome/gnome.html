<body><font size=2><h3>GNOME Inform 7</h3>
<p>
<p>This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more information on other contributors.
<p>
<p>Version 0.5 of GNOME Inform 7 was released in August 2007, less than a week after version 0.4. It updates the compiler to version 4X60, which is a fairly major revision and thus warrants a new release. GNOME Inform 7 started in August 2006 when I started designing the user interface purely to kill some time. By now, most features from the official Inform 7 version, except for the Skein and Transcript, are included. Please help me by reporting bugs to &lt;<a href="mailto:philip.chimento@gmail.com">philip.chimento@gmail.com</a>&gt;.
<p>Also, there are some shortcomings which I suppose don't count as bugs, as I am aware of them and have left them to be addressed in a subsequent version (or not at all):
<ul>
<li>There is no Skein and no Transcript. (I hope to have ported at least the Skein by the next major revision.)</li>
<li>The Replay command therefore doesn't replay through the skein; it just repeats the commands from the last time the game was played.</li>
<li>The syntax highlighting doesn't work quite the same way as in the OS X and Windows versions; I found it useful to highlight `if', `otherwise', `begin' and `end if' in another color. Also, nested comments are not highlighted correctly; this is a limitation of GtkSourceView.</li>
<li>On the Installed Extensions page, all the extensions will be listed as overridden by a locally installed version. This is a limitation of the compiler.</li>
<li>The interpreter on the Game tab does not handle color text or the more esoteric Unicode characters.</li>
</ul>
