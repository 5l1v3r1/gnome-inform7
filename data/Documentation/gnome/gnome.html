<body><font size=2><h3>GNOME Inform 7</h3>
<p>
This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more information on other contributors.
<p>
<p>This release does not correspond to a new version of the Inform 7 compiler: it is GNOME-only. The improvements are few, yet important. On systems using GTK 2.14 (new, popular distributions such as Ubuntu 8.10 and Fedora 10) it was impossible to start a new project anymore, because of an undefined-behavior bug that worked in previous versions and thus remained undetected. Also, the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/garglk/">Garglk project</a> spearheaded by Ben Cressey has been busy updating Gargoyle to meet the Glk 0.7.0 specification, and their improvements have been incorporated into GNOME Inform 7. One particular win is that indexed text did not work before, and now it does. In the meantime, a thorough overhaul is being done on GNOME Inform 7 and there are many long-awaited improvements in the works.
<p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: If you are upgrading from version 5J39 or earlier, and you are having problems with extensions, you may have to delete your ~/Inform directory and reinstall your extensions.
<p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: From version 5G67 onward, the GNOME Inform 7 source package will not include the compiler binaries anymore. If you compile GNOME Inform 7 from source, you will need to download the appropriate package from <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org">www.inform-fiction.org</a> and put the appropriate versions of `ni',  `inform-6.31-biplatform', and `cBlorb' in the directory `gnome-inform7/data/Compilers' before doing `make install'. This is in the interests of having a truly platform-independent source package, and also of shaving a few megabytes off the size of the source package. The Fedora and Ubuntu packages will continue to include binaries.
