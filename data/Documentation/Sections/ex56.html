Listing nondescript items of something</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> This activity prints up the also-ran paragraph at the end of a room description. These are nondescript items because they don't merit paragraphs of their own: if, as sometimes happens, there are none in the room, then no such paragraph is printed and this activity does not happen. (So to add a further paragraph to a room description, a simpler &quot;after looking&quot; rule should be used, not an &quot;after listing nondescript items&quot; rule.)
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> The paragraph ordinarily reads as &quot;You can also see a cask and a clock.&quot; or similar. Before the activity begins, those objects which are nondescript - in this case the cask and the clock - are given the property of being &quot;marked for listing&quot;. If it turns out that nothing is marked for listing, because of before rules like the one in the example below, then nothing is printed.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) Promoting something out of the nondescript category, by unmarking it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode66(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('Before listing nondescript items:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the watch is marked for listing:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]The watch catches your eye.[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]change the watch to not marked for listing.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');

<p>
<p>(b) Changing the normal phrasing of the paragraph. Note that we can also change the listing style; the one below is the default.

<a href="javascript:pasteCode428()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a>  &quot;The Eye of the Idol&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Reusable Material
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We start by defining relations that let us know where items &quot;belong&quot;, with the understanding that if something is where it belongs, it will be described in the main room description and therefore should not be separately listed. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Positioning relates various things to various things. The verb to be placed in implies the positioning relation. The verb to be placed on implies the positioning relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Room-positioning relates various things to various rooms. The verb to be room-placed in implies the room-positioning relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can't make relations relate various objects to various objects, and rooms are not things, so two separate cases are necessary. An alternative approach would be to say &quot;A thing has an object called the initial placement&quot;, which would allow a thing to have an initial placement that was a room, a supporter, or a container; an advantage of using relations, though, is that that way we can if we like specify multiple placements for the same object, so that, e.g., a sparkling diamond can be described in the main description paragraph as &quot;half-buried in dust&quot; in the beginning of the game, and then at the end as &quot;in the eye of the idol&quot; at the end.
<p>
<p>Now we define, based on these relations, an &quot;in-place&quot; adjective, which will identify whether something is in a location which will specially describe it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing (called prop) is in-place:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the prop is in the location and the prop is room-placed in the location, yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the holder of the prop is a thing and the prop is placed in the holder of the prop, yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is out-of-place if it is not in-place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With that done, removing these items automatically from the room description is actually pretty easy:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing nondescript items:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every marked for listing in-place thing is not marked for listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One tricky case remains: when something is placed on a supporter that is scenery, it can be mentioned even if we have marked that object &quot;not marked for listing&quot;. What matters here is not whether the object itself is marked for listing but whether the supporter has been &quot;mentioned&quot;. (A fuller description of how room descriptions are assembled is available in the Looking section of the Commands chapter in the Recipe Book.) So let's also add a feature whereby we can easily suppress the descriptions of these supporters when appropriate:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A supporter can be quiet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A quiet supporter is one that is never mentioned itself and which only mentions its contents if they are out of place. This allows for maximum flexibility in incorporating it into the body of room descriptions.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about a quiet supporter (called chosen table):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an out-of-place thing is on the chosen table:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an in-place thing is on the chosen table,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;On [the chosen table], in addition to [the list of in-place things on the chosen table], [is-are a list of out-of-place things which are on the chosen table].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;On [a chosen table] [is-are a list of out-of-place things which are on the chosen table].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the chosen table is mentioned.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that we can still override this with writing a paragraph rules about specific supporters in our game, if we decide that we want something a little different in some cases.
<p>
<p>Now, an example to test this out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - A Sample Scenario
