<p>
<p>The term preposition is used here, a little loosely, to mean anything which we add to the verb <i>to be</i> in order to talk about some relation or other. We have seen many examples already, such as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To be in - The ball is in the box.
<br>To be part of - The lever is part of the slot machine.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These are easier to create than verbs, because Inform already knows the wayward grammar of <i>to be</i>, so we need not give any of the principal parts. Otherwise, the method is exactly the same. Compare the definitions in the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Suspecting relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to suspect (he suspects, they suspect, he suspected, it is suspected, he is suspecting) implies the suspecting relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to be suspicious of implies the suspecting relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The result of this is that
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Hercule Poirot suspects Colonel Hotchkiss.
<br>Hercule Poirot is suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are exactly equivalent, and so are these two descriptions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">somebody who suspects Colonel Hotchkiss
<br>somebody suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can also define verbs as auxiliaries, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to be able to approach implies the approachability relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we can ask if Poirot &quot;can approach&quot; Hotchkiss, and so on. (Here again we need not spell out the other parts of the verb.)

<p>
<p>Now we want ways to set and unset all of these relations. (In the interests of thoroughness, we may get a bit far-fetched here. It is not recommended in practice that we make the player guess the verb &quot;traduce&quot;.)

<p>

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because love is a 1-1 relation, a person cannot love more than one other character at a time. Whenever we set a character to love a new person, that person ceases to love the character loved before. It is a fickle world.
<p>
<p>One to various relations are a bit more open: we can say someone impresses multiple other characters, and our additions to the list do not override the initial ones.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 3 - Setting and Unsetting Impressed (1-V)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;commend [someone] to [someone]&quot; as commending it to. Commending it to is an action applying to two visible things.

<p>

<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;traduce [someone] to [someone]&quot; as traducing it to. Traducing it to is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out traducing it to:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun], hearing your story, decides not to be at all impressed with [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And because this is a one-to-various relation, we can also make statements which set multiple relations at once, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;celebrate [someone]&quot; as celebrating. Celebrating is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out celebrating:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun impresses every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report celebrating:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The list of people who are impressed by the noun] take a very decided interest in [the noun].&quot;

<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;slander [someone]&quot; as slandering to. Slandering to is an action applying to one visible thing.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Now [the noun] impresses [the list of people who are impressed by the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that the above unsetting is not equivalent to &quot;now the noun does not impress every person&quot; -- which would be ambiguous in spoken English, as well. Various-to-one relations are similar:
<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report loathing: say &quot;You take [the noun] in disgust.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we cannot say &quot;now every person fancies every person&quot; or &quot;now every person is not fancied by every person&quot;. Variables on each side of the &quot;now&quot; statement are too much for Inform 7 to interpret usefully; we would need to write such a loop by hand, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;cause chaos&quot; as causing chaos. Causing chaos is an action applying to nothing.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report relieving chaos: say &quot;Now no one fancies anyone, which is safe but tedious.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Our options for setting and unsetting symmetrical relations are more limited again:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 6 - Setting and Unsetting Marriage (1-1 Symmetrical)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;marry [someone] to [someone]&quot; as uniting it in matrimony with. Uniting it in matrimony with is an action applying to two visible things.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report uniting it in matrimony with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You perform the marriage of [the noun] to [the second noun], joining them to the family of [a list of people related to the noun].&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;divorce [someone] from [someone]&quot; as divorcing it from. Divorcing it from is an action applying to two visible things.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is now not married to [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When we unset the symmetrical relation on one side, it is automatically set or unset on the other. It is not necessary to say &quot;the second noun is married to the noun&quot; or &quot;the second noun is not married to the noun&quot;, even though that is the case.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 7 - Setting and Unsetting Acquaintance (V-V Symmetrical)
