<p>What should fit into what? Inform has basically three sizes: small, person-sized, and room-sized. The difference between &quot;small&quot; and &quot;person-sized&quot; doesn't appear much, but it's the difference between an ordinary container and an enterable container; the fact that a person cannot get inside an ordinary container is one of the few size-related rules built into Inform. It will not object to, say, a fishing rod being put inside a matchbox.
<p>
<p>Inform does have one built-in measure of the size of a container: its &quot;capacity&quot;. This is a maximum number of contents:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The capacity of the rucksack is 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This of course allows three anvils, while forbidding four postage stamps. To do better, we need units of measurement, and <b>Dimensions</b> demonstrates setting these up.
<p>
<p>To be fully realistic in what will fit into what, we need sophisticated three-dimensional models of shapes, both of the items being carried and of the free space remaining inside containers. <b>Depth</b> elegantly simplifies this by approximating items as cuboids, with a given width, length and height: these multiply to give a volume. To fit in a container, a new item's volume must not exceed the volume remaining inside the container, and in addition its three dimensions must also fit in one of the possible arrangements at right angles to the sides. (So this system would indeed prevent a 1x1x100 fishing rod from being put inside a 5x2x1 matchbox, but would also prevent a 12x1x1 pencil from being put into a 10x10x1 box, because it would need to be turned diagonally to fit.)
<p>
<p><b>Lead Cuts Paper</b> provides a different constraint: here we do not let light-weight containers hold heavy objects.
<p>
<p>Weight comes in a different way into <b>Swerve left? Swerve right? Or think about it and die?</b>, which exploits up/down map connections to work out which way gravity would take a rolling marble.

<p>In the following, we pretend that every item has a cuboidal shape. Every thing has a length, width and depth, while a &quot;measured container&quot; also has interior dimensions. (Thus a 10x10x10 container with 1cm-thick sides might have interior dimensions 9x9x9.)

So we also insist the basic shape must fit, in some orientation perpendicular to one of the sides (i.e.: we can turn the item over in any of its three sides, but not turn it diagonally or wedge it in at a tilt). This requires the longest side of the item to be less than the longest side of the receptacle, and the middle-length side, and also the shortest side. The number of these conditions to fail gives us a clue as to how we can best describe the reason why the shape won't squeeze in.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check inserting something (called the item) into a measured container (called the receptacle):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the exterior volume of the item is greater than the interior volume of the receptacle, say &quot;[The item] will never fit inside [the receptacle].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the exterior volume of the item is greater than the available volume of the receptacle, say &quot;[The item] will not fit into [the receptacle] with [the list of things in the receptacle].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imagine the interior of the receptacle as a cuboid;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the largest dimension of the item is greater than the largest dimension of the imaginary cuboid, say &quot;[The item] is too long to fit into [the receptacle].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the middling dimension of the item is greater than the middling dimension of the imaginary cuboid, say &quot;[The item] is too wide to fit into [the receptacle].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the shortest dimension of the item is greater than the shortest dimension of the imaginary cuboid, say &quot;[The item] is too bulky to fit into [the receptacle].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally a situation to try out these rules.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cubist Lab is a room. &quot;A laboratory which, as the art critic Louis Vauxcelles said about Braque's paintings in 1908, is full of little cubes: everyday objects rendered as if cuboidal.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The box is a measured container. The interior height is 10 cm. The interior depth is 5 cm. The interior width is 6 cm. The player carries the box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A pebble is a kind of thing. The height is usually 2 cm. The depth is usually 2 cm. The width is usually 2 cm. The player carries 25 pebbles.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A red rubber ball is carried by the player. The depth is 5 cm. The width is 5 cm. The height is 5 cm.
<br>An arrow is carried by the player. The height is 40 cm. The width is 1 cm. The depth is 1 cm.
<br>A crusty baguette is carried by the player. The height is 80 cm. The width is 4 cm. The depth is 5 cm.
<br>A child's book is carried by the player. The height is 1 cm. The width is 9 cm. The depth is 9 cm.
<br>A featureless white cube is carried by the player. The height is 6 cm. The width is 6 cm. The depth is 6 cm.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;put arrow in box / put book in box / put cube in box / put ball in box / put baguette in box / put pebbles in box&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Several warnings about this. First, the numbers can't go very high (if the Settings for the project set the story file format to the Z-machine): while the volume can in theory go to 32,767, in practice this equates to an object 32 cm on a side, which is not very large. One way to avoid this is to use the Glulx format, allowing for sizes in excess of 10 m on a side: or we could simply scale the dimensions to suit our purposes, using a decimeter (10 cm) as the basic unit of measurement, for instance.
<p>
<p>Second, the system will require a height, width, and depth for every portable object in the game, which is a large commitment to data entry; it may become tiresome. So it is probably not worth bothering with this kind of simulation unless it is going to be genuinely significant.
