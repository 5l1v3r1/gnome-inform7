<p>
<p>Suppose we have some text called, once again, WHATEVER. Inform can get at its contents in a variety of ways. The lowest-level is by character - a character is a letter, digit, punctuation symbol, space or other letter-form. (We use the term &quot;character&quot; rather than &quot;letter&quot; because otherwise we would have to call &quot;5&quot; a letter, and so on.) Characters number upwards from 1: character number 1, to repeat that, starts the text. We can get the Nth character with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">character number N in WHATEVER
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The maximum character number varies with the current length of the text, and can be evaluated as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">number of characters in WHATEVER
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For instance, the number of characters in &quot;gazette&quot; is 7, and the number of characters in &quot;&quot; is 0.
<p>
<p>We can also extract the contents by word, again numbered from 1. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">word number N in WHATEVER
<br>number of words in WHATEVER
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is trickier than it looks, though, because what do we mean by word, exactly? The answer is: what's left after breaking the text up at punctuation or spacing (spaces, line breaks, paragraph breaks) and then removing that punctuation or spacing. So the number of words in &quot;ice-hot, don't you think?&quot; is 5: &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;don't&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;think&quot;. (Note that the contraction apostrophe in &quot;don't&quot; doesn't count as punctuation.) Because this is not always quite what we want, Inform offers two variations:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">punctuated word number N in WHATEVER
<br>number of punctuated words in WHATEVER
<br>unpunctuated word number N in WHATEVER
<br>number of unpunctuated words in WHATEVER
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The punctuated words in &quot;ice-hot, don't you think?&quot; are &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;don't&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, &quot;?&quot;. If two or more punctuation marks are adjacent, they are counted as different words, except for runs of dashes or periods: thus &quot;,,&quot; has two punctuated words, but &quot;--&quot; and &quot;...&quot; have only one each. The unpunctuated words in &quot;ice-hot, don't you think?&quot; are &quot;ice-hot,&quot;, &quot;don't&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;think?&quot; - here we are breaking words only at spacing, and treating punctuation as just another kind of letter.
<p>
<p>Finally, on the larger scale still, we also have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">line number N in WHATEVER
<br>number of lines in WHATEVER
<br>paragraph number N in WHATEVER
<br>number of paragraphs in WHATEVER
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Unless explicit use is made of line-breaking, lines and paragraphs will be the same - it doesn't refer to lines as visible on screen, because we have no way of knowing what size screen the player might have. But for instance
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Sensational news just in![paragraph break]The Martians have invaded Miranda.[line break](One of the moons of Uranus, that is.)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>has two paragraphs, but three lines.
<p>
<p>(Attempting to make large enough texts to have a serious paragraph count is slightly risky if there is not much memory to play with, as on the Z-machine. But the facilities do exist.)
