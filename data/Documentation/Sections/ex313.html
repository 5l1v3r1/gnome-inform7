<p>
<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode86(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');

}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode86()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Appraisal&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: if we have taken the idol then say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is &quot;follow ...&quot;, which is the first of several phrases allowing us to use rules whenever we want to (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such).
<p>
<p>When created, a rulebook starts out with no rules in it - in this example, of course, we quickly defined a couple of rules to go into it. But it's often the case in Inform that a rulebook exists without ever being stocked up, especially if the rulebook is for some obscure purpose never needed. The built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot;, applied to a rulebook, test whether any rule is present or not.
<p>
<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn, stopping when one rule reaches an outcome; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.

<p>
<p>
<p>But that's only a small part of the battle. The thing about fire is that it keeps on doing fiery things even when the player is otherwise occupied: destroying items that are on fire, and spreading to other things nearby. So we need a set of rules for the fire's behavior.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when something is flaming:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the fire rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fire rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule (this is the can't hold flaming objects rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through flaming things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is held by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let turns remaining be the endurance of the item minus the turns of burning of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if turns remaining is less than two:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try dropping the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is held by the player, say &quot;This is certainly painful.&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread the flames from the item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule (this is the fire destroys things rule):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change started printing to false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because we've labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual. For instance, if there were a pair of fireproof gloves in the game, we might want to turn off the &quot;can't hold flaming objects rule&quot; whenever the player is wearing them.
<p>
<p>This sort of flexibility is especially useful in the context of extensions. Someone writing an extension about burning would have no way of anticipating the need for a Fireproof Gauntlet of Thog, but the author would nonetheless be able to implement one easily.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is vulnerable if it is flammable and it is whole.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The contact between things is a critical factor when it comes to fire, so we might add a couple of conditional relations do determine what is touching what.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be relying on implies the reliance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is relying on Y or Y is relying on X. The verb to be joined to implies the contact relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Having these at our disposal makes it much tidier to write what happens next:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To spread the flames from (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change started printing to false;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now all the flammable whole things joined to the item are flaming.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of touching something which is within a flaming thing (called the receptacle):

<p>
<p>And that completes the rules which cover burning: things can catch fire, fire will spread, and gradually consume the world in flames. All of that was general and could be used in any setting, but we now provide a small game to show it off.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part II - Escape from the Library of the Dead

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The world's last manuscript of the Psychagogoi by Aeschylus is on the desk. The manuscript is flammable. The manuscript has endurance 1.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The torch is a flammable flaming thing carried by the player. It has endurance 60. The asbestos sack is a flame-retardant player's holdall in the drawer.

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going through the closed trapdoor, say &quot;[The trapdoor] is closed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can then add a special fire rule to handle the trapdoor, which will be called as part of the same sequence. Again, this would be most important if the fire rules were part of a standard extension, and the trapdoor fire rule the author's own addition.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule:
