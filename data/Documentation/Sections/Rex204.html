<p>The simplest form of clock is a wrist watch. Here is a choice of analogue or digital:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a wrist watch. The description of the wrist watch is &quot;It is [the time of day in words].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a digital watch. The description of the digital watch is &quot;It is [the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Better clocks would allow us also to set the time, and to stop and start them: see <b>Tom's Midnight Garden</b>.
<p>
<p>Scientific instruments provide sharper versions of our own senses. In the case of vision, they allow us to see closer up, or further away. It's a convention of IF that people can normally see only the current location, that is, they cannot see from one location into another. The boundary of the current room is like a horizon, even out of doors (though it's true that there are ways to disguise that with a continuous outdoor landscape). <b>Ginger Beer</b> provides a telescope able to see into other rooms.
<p>
<p><b>Witnessed 2</b> provides a meter which measures how close a ghost is to the player.
