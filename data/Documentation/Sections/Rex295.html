<p>
<p>Before implementing elaborate mechanisms to handle plumbing, we should pause to ask ourselves: how much of this do we need? Is it really necessary to simulate the complete set of fixtures and fittings?
<p>
<p>This turns out to be a little tricky to do, and also rather dull to set out. The example <b>Modern Conveniences</b> was actually written as a demonstration of how an extension to Inform might be written to provide a general &quot;kitchens and bathrooms service&quot; for writers, but it contains a nice implementation well worth borrowing. The idea is to provide a &quot;kitchen&quot; kind of room and a &quot;bathroom&quot; kind of room. All kitchens created automatically contain standard kitchen appliances: fridge, freezer, sink with taps, counters, cabinets, and a stovetop with built-in oven. Similarly, all bathrooms will have sinks, baths, cabinets, and toilets, and respond to some standard interactions.

<p>Suppose we want to write an extension or other portable code which defines a &quot;kitchen&quot; kind of room and a &quot;bathroom&quot; kind of room. All kitchen rooms we create in the future will automatically contain standard kitchen appliances: fridge, freezer, sink with taps, counters, cabinets, and a stovetop with built-in oven. Similarly, all bathrooms will have sinks, baths, cabinets, and toilets, and respond to some standard interactions.
<p>
<p>We would do this with a standard assembly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">

    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Modern Conveniences"\n\nSection 1 - Kitchens\n\nA kitchen is a kind of room.\n\nA refrigerator is a kind of container. A refrigerator is usually closed and openable.

A freezer is usually closed and openable. A freezer compartment is part of every refrigerator.\n\n[Now: we\'re going to want many of the items in our kitchen to have switches, and to handle input sensibly regardless of whether the player types TURN ON STOVE or TURN ON STOVE SWITCH. (This is apparently a stove with only one burner.) For convenience, we\'ll define an "includes" relation:]\n\nInclusion relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when Y is part of X. The verb to include (it includes, they include, it included, it is included) implies the inclusion relation.\n\nA stove is a kind of supporter. It is usually scenery.\nAn oven is a kind of container. An oven is usually openable and closed. One oven is a part of every stove.\nA switch is a kind of device. A switch is part of every stove. A switch is part of every oven.\nUnderstand "[something related by reversed incorporation] switch" as a switch.\n\n[What follows is fairly straightforward, but notice that we are somewhat obsessively naming every rule.

A sink is usually fixed in place and scenery. A tap is a kind of switch. A tap is part of every sink. Understand "faucet" or "taps" as a tap.

Understand "john" as a toilet. A toilet is usually fixed in place and enterable and scenery.\n\nA bath is a kind of container. A bath is usually a fixed in place and enterable and scenery. A tap is part of every bath. A drain is part of every bath. Understand "bathtub" or "shower" as a bath.\n\nA sink is in every bathroom.\nA toilet is in every bathroom.\nA bath is in every bathroom.\nA cabinet is in every bathroom.\n\n[If we were feeling particularly ambitious and inclined toward interior decoration, we could add bath mats, mirrors, plungers, toilet brushes, overhead lighting, towel racks, scented candles, boxes of facial tissue, shampoo bottles, scrubbing loofahs, etc. ad nauseam; but we\'ll keep it relatively simple for now. Of course, if we have a toilet, we pretty much have to accept that the player will try to make use of it:]\n\nUnderstand "flush [toilet]" or "use [toilet]" as a mistake ("You have no need at the moment.").\n\nUnderstand "take shower" or "take bath" or "bathe" or "wash" as bathing.

But items that have been assigned rooms are not named in the same way, so we cannot talk about "the Industrial Kitchen\'s stove" in our code as a way to assign it a description or special behavior. In quite a simple example, we could make the descriptions of the kind simply be the descriptions we want for the individual items:]\n\nSection 3 - An Example We Might Offer\n\nOur Household Kitchen is a kitchen.\n\nThe Tiny Bathroom is a bathroom. It is west of Our Household Kitchen.\n\nThe description of a stove is "Scrupulously polished."\n\nThe description of a refrigerator is "It is baby blue and has the contours of a 50\'s chevy. One of these days it really will break down, but it\'s been serving your family faithfully since your grandmother\'s honeymoon."\n\nTest me with "x refrigerator / open fridge / x freezer / look in freezer / open freezer / turn on stove / turn on oven / x oven switch / turn off oven switch / turn off stove switch / turn on taps / x sink / w / x sink / turn on sink / take bath / use toilet".\n\n');

<p>
<p>Now we might put this to work in a short example.
<p>
<p>One slight challenge lies in giving these assembled pieces separate descriptions. When we have an assembly that adds parts to objects, we can then talk about (for instance) &quot;the stove's switch&quot; elsewhere in the code. But items that have been assigned rooms are not named in the same way, so we cannot talk about &quot;the Industrial Kitchen's stove&quot; in our code as a way to assign it a description or special behavior. In quite a simple example, we could make the descriptions of the kind simply be the descriptions we want for the individual items:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 3 - An Example We Might Offer
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Our Household Kitchen is a kitchen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tiny Bathroom is a bathroom. It is west of Our Household Kitchen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a stove is &quot;Scrupulously polished.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a refrigerator is &quot;It is baby blue and has the contours of a 50's chevy. One of these days it really will break down, but it's been serving your family faithfully since your grandmother's honeymoon.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x refrigerator / open fridge / x freezer / look in freezer / open freezer / turn on stove / turn on oven / x oven switch / turn off oven switch / turn off stove switch / turn on taps / x sink / w / x sink / turn on sink / take bath / use toilet&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In a game that featured multiple bathrooms and kitchens, this wouldn't be enough; our author might give the stove kind (say) a description that checked its location, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a stove is &quot;[if in Industrial Kitchen]A massive stainless steel stove-top with six burners[otherwise]Your standard four-burner item[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or create an
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the stove in the Industrial Kitchen: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>sort of rule for those objects he wanted to describe specially; or he might use a when play begins rule to initialize a few things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let N be a random stove in the Industrial Kitchen;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the boiling pot to N;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the description of N to...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or we might even (if we anticipate lots of these kinds of amendments) want to rig up something more complex that finds the descriptions of appliances in a table, rather than relying on their individual description properties. This can all be done, but it is only interesting as long as it remains genuinely labor-saving: that is, as long as the convenience of having the assembly is greater than the annoyance of writing special rules to cover for the automation. In the end, the &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bathroom&quot; room types are likely to be most useful for authors who want to include the standard props but not actually make them a critical part of the game; if stoves and sinks have more of a starring role in the production, authors may be better off coding them or at the very least placing them by hand, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Industrial Kitchen is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thor is a stove in the Industrial Kitchen. It supports a boiling pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All these quirks are things that we (as the extension author) want to think out in advance: we should ideally warn authors about possible pitfalls in using our extension (if we can think of them) and point out ways of customizing the behavior (if there are interesting ways).
