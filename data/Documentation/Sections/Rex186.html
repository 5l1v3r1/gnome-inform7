<p>
<p>Sometimes we want to arrange a scene in which something goes on in the background (as though it were a movie playing) while the player goes about his business; or where a series of things has to happen before the player gets to the end.
<p>
<p>The simplest way to arrange background events for a scene is to write the sequence of events into a table and work our way through it, printing one line per turn, until the scene runs out. <b>Day One</b> does exactly this.
<p>
<p>At other times, we want a scene to last as long as it takes the <i>player</i> to do something. <b>Entrapment</b> lets the player poke around and explore as much as he likes, but ends as soon as he has accomplished the scene's goal - which, unfortunately for him, is to get into an embarrassing situation so that another character can walk in and make fun of him. <b>The Prague Job</b> has a scene that requires the player to do a more specific set of tasks, but nags him and hurries him along until he's done.
<p>
<p>For more complex sorts of scripts and schedules, it may be worth consulting the extensions.

<br>&quot;Freitag takes a breath. 'No, my dear freshwomen, what you are here to do is learn facts. FACTS.

<br>&quot;Everyone is silent.&quot;
<br>&quot;The lecture is interrupted by the shrill of a bell.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And then we define the scene so that it ends when the table runs out.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lecture ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Lecture Events is 0.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One advantage of this is that we can then edit the events in the scene by changing just the table; the scene will always run the right length and end on the turn when the last event occurs.
<p>
<p>And to add a few additional details:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than waiting, looking, listening or examining during Lecture:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Dr Freitag glares at you so fiercely that you are frozen into inaction.&quot;

<p>
<p>Notice the careful phrasing of &quot;doing something other than...&quot; so that we do not mention the objects; if we had written &quot;something other than listening to something...&quot;, the instead rule would match only action patterns which involved a noun. We state the rule more generally so that it will also match nounless commands such as JUMP and SING, since Freitag will probably take a dim view of those as well.
