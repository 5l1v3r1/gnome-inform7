<p>
<p>Lastly we can also ask for a more specific number of possibilities, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if two women are carrying animals
<br>if at most three doors are open
<br>if fewer than 10 portable containers are closed
<br>if all but two of the devices are switched on
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Likewise for &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;more than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;all except&quot;. Something to watch out for is that
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if two doors are open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be found true if there are (say) three open doors: after all, if three doors are open, then certainly two doors are. So this is not quite counting. We can be more precise by writing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if exactly two doors are open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;all but&quot; counts - say, &quot;if all but two doors are open&quot; - are exact: if, in fact, all of the doors are open then this will be found false.
<p>
<p>Lastly, note that the &quot;the&quot; in text like &quot;two of the doors&quot; matters: without it, the phrase will not be recognised as a requirement on the number. (This is to make sure that names of things like &quot;two of hearts&quot; are not misinterpreted.)
