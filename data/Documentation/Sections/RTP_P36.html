<b>P36 - File being read is not a previously saved table</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

The contents of tables can be saved into disc files and subsequently loaded in again, perhaps on a different run, or even into the same table but in a different project. Here, I tried to load in such a file, but it turned out not to be that sort of file at all - it had not previously been saved from a table.
