Position Within Rooms</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Inform's division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.
<p>
<p>Suppose we want things to happen differently in different corners of the same room? Inform can already do this a little, in that the player can be inside an enterable container or on an enterable supporter. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of opening a door when the player is on the bed, say &quot;You can't reach the handle from the bed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we need to have divided-up areas of the floor itself, the standard approach is to define a small number of named positions. We then need to remember at which of these locations the player (or something else) currently stands.
<p>
<p><b>Further Reasons Why All Poets Are Liars</b> allows the player to be in different parts of a room by standing on a box which can be in different places: thus only the box needs an internal position, not the player, simplifying matters neatly.
<p>
<p>Another interesting case is when one room is entirely inside another (such as a hut in a field, or a booth in a large convention hall), so that the exterior of the room should be visible from another location. <b>Starry Void</b> gives a simple demonstration of a magician's booth that can be examined from the outside, opened and closed, and entered to reach a new location.
