<p>
<p>Electrons are so tiny, and move so fast, that we will never want to simulate them in ordinary IF. So we simply regard electricity and magnetism as behaviours which are either present or not present, and which have instantaneous effects.
<p>
<p>In <b>Witnessed 1</b>, batteries provide electricity to enable a &quot;device&quot; to work. Even if switched on, a device with no battery will be ineffective.
<p>
<p>Larger voltages are exposed in <b>Electrified</b>, which makes certain items untouchable, and ensures that an experienced electrician will not even try.
<p>
<p><b>Rules of Attraction</b> provides for a magnet which attracts metallic items just strongly enough to stick together until pulled apart for any reason.

<p>The following example makes fairly ample use of material that we haven't seen yet, but gives some idea of the flexibility of every turn rules. Suppose we want to have a number of electrical devices, all of which may be powered by a set of batteries. The batteries will all need to be discharged as they are used (regardless of what device they happen to be controlling at the moment). So:
