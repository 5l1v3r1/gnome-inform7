<p>
<p>Relative location can also be important: relative to other people, that is -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something in the presence of Lady Bracknell, say &quot;Lady Bracknell disapproves thoroughly of gentlemen who snack between meals, and there are few disapprovals in this world quite so thorough as Lady Bracknell's.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As might be guessed, this applies when the action takes place in the same location as the person named: and of course that person can also be described more vaguely (&quot;... in the presence of a woman&quot;, say), and can just as easily be an inanimate thing (&quot;... in the presence of the radio set&quot;).
<p>
<p>Lady Bracknell is a pushover compared to some matriarchs:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than looking, examining or waiting in the presence of the Queen: say &quot;I'm afraid they take what you might call a zero tolerance approach to breaches of court etiquette here.&quot;; end the game saying &quot;You have been summarily beheaded&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The last of the optional clauses we can tack on to the description of an action is the most general of all. We can add &quot;when&quot; and then any condition at all, as in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something when the radio set is switched on, say &quot;Something about the howling short-wave static puts you right off luncheon.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This supposes that the radio is so loud that it can be heard from any room: we could muffle it so that it's only audible from the room it is in like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something in the presence of the radio set when the radio set is switched on, say &quot;Something about the howling short-wave static puts you right off luncheon.&quot;
