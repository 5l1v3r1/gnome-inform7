<b>P47 - Phrase applied to an incompatible kind of value</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

<p>
When Inform is given one or more definitions for a phrase, and it is not clear in advance that these definitions apply to a particular situation, it has to check this during play. If it turns out that none of the available definitions can apply, this run-time problem is generated.<p>For instance, suppose the source defines: <font color="#000080"><b>To greet (M - a man): ...</b></font> and also <font color="#000080"><b>To greet (W - a woman): ...</b></font>, and also says: <font color="#000080"><b>Before kissing someone (called the partner), greet the partner.</b></font> And suppose the player then does something which the author didn't expect, by typing KISS FELIX, where Felix is a cat (an object of kind <font color="#000080"><b>person</b></font>, but neither a <font color="#000080"><b>man</b></font> nor a <font color="#000080"><b>woman</b></font>). Inform is then unable to apply <font color="#000080"><b>greet</b></font> correctly because neither definition can be applied the Felix's kind.
