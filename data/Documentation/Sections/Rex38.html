<p>Very occasionally, for out-of-the-ordinary games, we want to make major changes to the way that Inform ordinarily understands commands.
<p>
<p><b>Cloves</b> shows how we might read adverbs in the player's command: adverbs are challenging because they can legitimately appear anywhere in a command structure, so must be found and accounted for before the rest of the command is understood.
<p>
<p><b>Fragment of a Greek Tragedy</b> goes further, substituting a keyword-recognition parser for the usual structure of commands and objects.

<p>It has sometimes been suggested that IF should allow for the player to use adverbs, so that doing something &quot;carefully&quot; will have a different effect from doing it &quot;quickly&quot;. There are several inherent challenges here: it's a good idea to make very sure the player knows all his adverb options, and the list of possibilities should probably not be too long.
<p>
<p>Another trick is that adverbs complicate understanding commands, because they can occur anywhere: one might type >GO WEST CAREFULLY or >CAREFULLY GO WEST, and ideally the game should understand both. After reading a command is the best point to do this sort of thing, because we can find adverbs, interpret them, and remove them from the command stream. So:

<p>
<p>Now we have, automatically, a value called manner understood to be used whenever parsing manners, and we can use this even during the &quot;after reading a command&quot; stage, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;[manner]&quot;:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;But how, my dear boy, how? You simply can't do something without a pose. Thus far you have mastered doing things defiantly, sheepishly, or insouciantly.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject the player's command.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: change the left hand status line to &quot;Behaving [manner understood]&quot;; change the right hand status line to &quot;[location]&quot;; change the manner understood to insouciantly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Poseur Club is a room. &quot;Lady Mary is laid out on a sofa, her wrists bandaged importantly[if the manner understood is insouciantly] -- and she looks all the more depressed by your indifference to her state[end if]; Salvatore is at the gaming table, clutching his hair with both hands[if the manner understood is defiantly] -- though he looks up long enough to snarl in response to that expression of yours[end if]; Frackenbush is muttering lines from another of his works in progress, as though poetry has nearly made him mad[if the manner understood is sheepishly].

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when the manner understood is insouciantly:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when the manner understood is defiantly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You raise your chin and give a pointed glance around the room as though to say that you are waiting for someone; you are unembarrassed about waiting for her; you have by no means been stood up; and the first person to comment will receive a poke in the eye.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before looking when the manner understood is sheepishly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You gaze up from under your brows...&quot;

<p>

<p>

<p>
<p>The qualification about turn count is to prevent this before message from occurring when the player first looks around the room (automatically) at the start of play.
<p>
<p>Note that to test this example, one must type INSOUCIANTLY TEST ME, and not simply TEST ME: a poseur's work is never done.
