<b>P52 - This interpreter does not support Unicode</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

You probably won't see this text, because the Inform user interfaces contain copies of the glulxe, the Glulx interpreter, which do indeed support Unicode. Anyway, the story file wants to use Unicode characters or manipulate indexed text, but can't because Unicode isn't available on what must be an out of date copy of the glulxe/glk interpreter.
