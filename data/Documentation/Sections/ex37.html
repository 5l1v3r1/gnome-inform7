Phrases concerning rules</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>The &quot;ignore&quot; phrase is only one of a suite. The full list is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">ignore ...rule...
<br>reinstate ...rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;reinstate&quot; phrase simply reverses any previous &quot;ignore&quot; of the same rule, and is otherwise not useful.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">reject the result of ...rule...
<br>accept the result of ...rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Some rules produce results, as we shall see in the next section, but they can be set so that whatever result they produce will be ignored. Again, &quot;accept ...&quot; simply undoes a previous &quot;reject ...&quot; and otherwise has no effect.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">substitute ...first rule... for ...second rule...
<br>restore the original ...second rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whenever the second rule is to be invoked - from any rulebook, or as a result of any &quot;follow&quot; instruction - invoke the first one instead. Again, &quot;restore ...&quot; simply undoes the effect of an earlier &quot;substitute&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move ...first rule... to before/after ...second rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This causes the first rule to be ignored whenever it turns up in the ordinary way, but to be invoked either immediately before or immediately after the second rule whenever that second rule is invoked. In effect, it cuts out the first rule from wherever it was, and glues it onto the second. Note that there is no obligation for the first rule to begin in the same rulebook(s) as the second, so this can be used to slot in a wholly new rule, perhaps only if certain circumstances hold.
<p>
<p>These rule-changing instructions allow apparently casual sentences to wreak havoc with the model world. This, for instance, is quite the recipe for mayhem and perplexity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule: reject the result of the before rules; ignore the after rules; move the after rules to before the before rules.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Observation of novice IF players suggests that they often have a hard time figuring out how to get started, especially if they are encountering the game in a truth state where they don't have time to settle in and read instructions. Here we provide some training wheels to help them learn to communicate.
<p>
<p>This is divided into several parts. The first part is the system of rules for general guidance, which could be excerpted and true anywhere. The second part is a scenario using these rules; and in the third part, we play with a change to the situation which leads us to want to rearrange the rulebook.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Have you played interactive fiction before? >&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player consents, change novice mode to false;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise change novice mode to true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The rationale for asking the question this way, and not another, is that novices asked whether they would like instructions very often say no, even if they need them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Novice mode is a truth state that varies. Novice mode is true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Stopping novice mode is an action out of world.
<br>Starting novice mode is an action out of world.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;novice mode off&quot; or &quot;novice off&quot; as stopping novice mode.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The suggestion about asking for help is no good unless we provide some. This might take any of a number of forms, but for the sake of example we'll use an easy way out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short. Include Menus by Emily Short. Include Basic Help Menu by Emily Short.
