Writing a paragraph about</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Just <i>before</i> writing a paragraph about some item in a room description.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is to do nothing. However, if a rule is supplied which prints something up, then this replaces the paragraph which would otherwise have been printed. Moreover, any items whose names are said in the course of this rule - for instance, by being listed - are then excluded from the remainder of the room description, because they are considered as having been described sufficiently already.
<p>
<p>Warning: because we often want a &quot;for&quot; rule for this activity to make some calculation and then possibly choose to do nothing (see the example &quot;Otranto&quot;), Inform suppresses the usual paragraph not when a &quot;for&quot; rule took effect but when it detected a paragraph having been printed. This can get confused if a text substitution affecting paragraph breaks, say &quot;[line break]&quot;, is within the final &quot;say&quot; of a &quot;for writing a paragraph about&quot; rule.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) This is a neat way to wrap several things together into the same paragraph:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode65(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Wickham:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Mr Wickham looks speculatively at [list of women in the location].[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode65()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Wickham:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at [list of women in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because now &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at Velma and Daphne&quot; will now prevent the appearance of the subsequent text &quot;You can also see Velma and Daphne.&quot;
<p>
<p>Inform keeps track of which objects have already been named with an either/or property called &quot;mentioned&quot;, which it assigns whenever the name of an object has been automatically printed. So in this case, Velma and Daphne are now mentioned. Note &quot;automatically printed&quot;, though: if the text printed had just been &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at Velma and Daphne&quot;, rather than the text-substitution list used above, then Inform would not know that Velma and Daphne have been described.
<p>
<p>If we ever need to override this - say, we want to list all the women but make sure that Velma gets another paragraph anyway - we could change Velma to unmentioned again after the listing.

<p>To start with, let's understand &quot;room&quot; to mean &quot;a group of people talking&quot;. These groups can grow and shrink as people come and go, so we'll want to name and rename them; and we're also going to need some rules to motivate people moving around, and a description to narrate how they behave when we're with them.

<p>And now we use writing a paragraph about... to describe character behavior in groups, when we join them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Frank Churchill:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains a woman (called flirt) who is desired by Frank:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Frank Churchill] is talking with great animation and slightly more than becoming warmth to [the flirt][if an unmentioned other person is in the location], while [the list of unmentioned other people in the location] look on with varying degrees of amusement or irritation[end if].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Churchill and the character is not the flirt, change the character to bored.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Elton:

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Knightley:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains an unmentioned man (called the listener) who is not Mr Knightley:

<p>
<p>Since this is just an example, we'll stop here, but there's no reason we couldn't write such paragraphs for everyone.
