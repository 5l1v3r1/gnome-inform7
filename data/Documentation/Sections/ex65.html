Text with random alternatives</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Sometimes we would like to provide a little quirky variation in text, especially in messages which will be seen often. We can achieve this with the &quot;[one of]... [or] ... [or] ...&quot; construction. In the text, &quot;[one of]&quot; must be followed by two or more alternatives divided by &quot;[or]&quot;s, and concluding with one of a variety of possible outcomes to say how to use the alternatives. The simplest is &quot;[purely at random]&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You flip the coin. [one of]Heads[or]Tails[purely at random]!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Exactly half of the time the text will be printed as &quot;You flip the coin. Heads!&quot;; and the other half, &quot;You flip the coin. Tails!&quot;.
<p>
<p>Often, though, although we want a random choice, we would really prefer to avoid the same choice coming up twice running, because of the deadening effect of repeating the exact same message twice. So the &quot;[at random]&quot; option is provided to make a (uniformly) random choice of outcomes other than the most recent one.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The light changes randomly again; now it's [one of]green[or]amber[or]red[at random].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Here we can safely say the light &quot;changes&quot;, because the new colour cannot be the same as the one printed the last time.)
<p>
<p>Randomness can also be used not to make the text constantly change, but to make it unique to this playing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The newspaper headline is: [one of]War Casualties[or]Terrorists[or]Banks[sticky random] [one of]Continue To Expand[or]Lose Out[sticky random].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Sticky randomness&quot; means that a choice is made once only, and that it sticks from there on. Although the newspaper headline will change with each playing, it will not alter during play.
<p>
<p>In the above techniques, the alternatives were all equally likely, but we can also have an idea of rarity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Zorro strides by, [one of]looking purposeful[or]grim-faced[or]deep in thought[or]suppressing a yawn[or]scratching his ribs[or]trying to conceal that he has cut himself shaving[as decreasingly likely outcomes].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are six outcomes here: the first is six times as likely as the last, and those in between are similarly scaled, so Zorro cuts himself shaving only once in 21 tries, while he looks purposeful almost a third of the time.
<p>
<p>But suppose we want to tuck some useful information in these messages, and we want to be sure that the player will see it. Because all of the above options involve randomness, it's possible that an unlucky player might miss a clue placed into only one variant of the message. We can prevent this like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You dip into the chapter on [one of]freshwater fish[or]hairless mammals[or]extinct birds[or]reptiles such as the black salamander[in random order].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>What happens is that a random order is chosen for the (in this case) four outcomes. If we print the above text four times, it will print each variation just once, and when one random cycle finishes, a new one begins. The effect is somewhat like the &quot;shuffle album&quot; feature on an iPod. (One small restriction: if there are more than 32 variations, purely random choices will be printed and there will be no guarantee that repeats are prevented.)
<p>
<p>A simpler way to ensure that the player sees what we want is to remove the element of randomness altogether. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;[one of]The phone rings[or]The phone rings a second time[or]The phone rings again[stopping].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Stopping&quot; here means that on the third and all subsequent printings, we stop at the last variation, that is, &quot;The phone rings again.&quot; The alternative is &quot;cycling&quot;, where we go back to the beginning:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The pundits discuss [one of]the weather[or]world events[or]celebrity gossip[cycling].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And round and round they go.

<p>
<p>And since (textual variation or not) we do want the player to be able to see all these objects:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Jeremy carries white onions, celery, carrots, and herbs. Jeremy's station is scenery in the kitchen. It is a supporter.

<p>
<p>Jeremy is following a sequence of actions to do an implied task (still somewhat robotically, but it will do for now). Animals might be a bit more capricious, though:

<p>
<p>The housefly's description is merely &quot;at random&quot; rather than &quot;purely at random&quot; because we want to show it doing a different thing each turn, whereas Fluffy could plausibly stare out the window for five turns in a row.
<p>
<p>There are more complex ways to change and override the initial descriptions of people and things; if text alternatives do not get us far enough, we can turn to the &quot;rule for writing a paragraph about,&quot; documented in the Activities chapter.
<p>
<p>Another frequent use of text alternatives is to give characters a bit of variety in things they're likely to say many times in the course of a game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of telling Jeremy about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Jeremy looks [one of]surprised[or]intrigued[or]nonplussed[at random]. '[one of]You don't say[or]That's very interesting[or]Do go on[or]I wish I'd known that sooner[at random]!'&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or, with somewhat more complexity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Jeremy about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'[one of]Sorry,[or]I'm afraid[or]Hm,[at random] [one of]I don't know much about that[or]you've got me there[or]I haven't the faintest[at random],' Jeremy [one of]drawls[or]replies[or]comments[or]exclaims[at random]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[one of][or] huskily[or] throatily[or] silkily[or] in a deep manly voice[as decreasingly likely outcomes].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that, in that last line, our first option is entirely blank. If we put nothing as an element of the text alternatives list, this means that printing nothing at all is a viable alternative. In fact, we've made this the most common probability out of the decreasingly likely outcomes, so that five times in fifteen, or a third of the time the text is run, there will be no modifier printed at all.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;look / g / g / g / ask Jeremy about his feelings for me / ask jeremy about his amnesia / tell Jeremy about my unborn child&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As this example (alas) reveals, text alternatives will not go all the way toward making our characters into compelling conversationalists; we will have to wait until we know more about Actions. But at least we have abolished the default responses, and given Jeremy a touch of personality, however witless.
