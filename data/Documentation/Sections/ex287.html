Review of Chapter 10: Scenes</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>1. A <b>scene</b> is a stretch of time somewhere in our narrative. We might choose to use scenes to organize the entire structure of our plot; just for timed or occasional events; or not at all, as we prefer.
<p>
<p>Scenes are a flexible way to keep an eye on and react to complex aspects of the world state, so they might for instance be used to monitor whether or not puzzles have been completed, determine when it is time to move the player to a new location, provide background activity, and so on.
<p>
<p>2. We define a new scene with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a scene.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A scene has only a single beginning but is allowed to have many different named endings. We indicate how our scenes are to begin and end like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop begins when ...
<br>Train Stop ends when ...
<br>Duel to the Death ends tragically when ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These need not be simple rules. If necessary, long wordy conditions can be given: or, using techniques from the chapter on phrases, we could define a phrase to make a really complicated decision.
<p>
<p>Scenes cannot be begun or ended just by saying so, using &quot;now&quot;. Although the condition &quot;the Horrible Argument is happening&quot; correctly tests for whether this scene is under way, demands like &quot;now the Horrible Argument is happening&quot; or &quot;now the Duel to the Death has ended&quot; are not allowed - scenes begin and end only when the conditions are met. There are several reasons for this, but one is that it makes it possible for the Scene Index to keep track of how scenes fit together in the course of our story.
<p>
<p>3. Just as rooms are joined together by map connections, we can join scenes together so that they lead one into another or run in parallel:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Passenger Throng ends when Train Stop ends.
<br>Train Departure begins when Train Stop ends.
<br>Train Departure ends when Nightfall begins.
<br>Owl Screeching begins when Nightfall begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or we can say that a scene begins &quot;when play begins&quot;.
<p>
<p>4. We can write rules applying during the scene like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Train Stop: ...
<br>Before taking the luggage during Train Stop: ...
<br>After listening when Train Stop is happening: ...
<br>Instead of going to the Outdoor Region during Train Stop: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We may also check afterward whether a scene has happened:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing Miss Tilford when Train Stop has happened: ...
<br>&quot;The Waiting Room is freshly painted.[if Train Stop has ended] But it somehow seems desolate now.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and so on. For instance, we could use such conditions to assemble a summary of the plot so far for the player.
<p>
<p>5. More than one scene can be happening at the same time, so it is not sensible to talk about &quot;the current scene&quot;, in the way that we talk about the location of the player. The player can only be in one room at a time, but he can be in the midst of multiple scenes (or none).

<p>
<p>As we have seen, there are a number of different ways of controlling conversation in interactive fiction, and the best choice of way will depend quite a lot on what kind of work we're writing.
<p>
<p>One common model is to replace Inform's default ASK and TELL commands with a TALK TO command. This gives the player less control than he would otherwise have: instead of asking a character about any topic under the sun, he's restricted to seeing (or not seeing) a single sequence of text that the author has written in advance. On the other hand, such a system is harder for the player to break (since he can never ask about a topic that the author hasn't implemented), and easier for the author to tie into plot developments. If we give TALK TO different output at each scene, we get conversation that is always tied to the current state of the plot.
<p>
<p>This is a design approach that works best in a game with a large number of short, focused scenes. For other kinds of conversation system design, compare the other examples listed in the Recipe Book.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Chapter 2 - Specific scenes and talking
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, suppose we have a situation -- say, a stage play -- in which it is appropriate to talk to different characters at different times. During the prologue of the play, no one else is on-stage, and the player is to address the audience directly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Prologue
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change right hand status line to &quot;416 BC&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change left hand status line to &quot;[location]&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Prologue is a scene. Prologue begins when play begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Theater of Dionysus is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The audience is a person in the Theater. &quot;The usual audience looks on: the priests and judges in the front row, and then Athenians, metics, and foreigners.&quot; The audience can be prepared or unprepared. The description is &quot;Have you ever seen such a company of perjurers, pathics, and thieves?&quot; Understand &quot;priest&quot; or &quot;priests&quot; or &quot;priest of dionysus&quot; or &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; or &quot;athenians&quot; or &quot;metics&quot; or &quot;foreigners&quot; as the audience.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to the player when the Prologue is happening:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There will be plenty of occasion for muttered asides later in the play, but for now you must prepare the audience for things to come.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to the audience when the Prologue is happening:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Drawing breath, you turn to the audience, and offer them a genial, witty, colorful, and of course crude synopsis of what they are about to see; describing all the characters in unmistakable terms and not omitting the most important of them all, your august self.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the audience is prepared.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to the audience when the Prologue has happened:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You may only direct monologues to the audience when the other actors are off-stage. Otherwise, their characters might have to notice.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Prologue ends when the audience is prepared.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But there might follow a scene in which the player shouldn't talk at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Parodos
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Parodos is a scene. Parodos begins when Prologue ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Parodos begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the chorus to the theater;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to someone during Parodos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Sssh: this moment belongs to the chorus. They've worked so hard on it, after all.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Parodos ends when the time since Parodos began is 4 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The chorus is a person. The description is &quot;They are dressed in exaggerated rural costume and feminine masks, as they are meant to represent a company of female cheese-makers from the Spartan-occupied deme of Dekeleia.&quot; Understand &quot;cheesewives&quot; or &quot;cheese-makers&quot; or &quot;chorus-leader&quot; as the chorus.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Parodos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Choral Events
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[output entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make no decision;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Choral Events
<br>output
<br>&quot;The chorus now begins its entry, accompanying with anapestic song its march up the eisodos.&quot;
<br>&quot;The chorus draws nearer, stomping and clomping and swinging their baskets of cheese.&quot;
<br>&quot;You stand aside as the chorus fills the orchestra and dances to and fro.&quot;
<br>&quot;The tune of the aulos-player grows more and more frenzied and then breaks off.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This last rule is a refinement borrowing from the Activities chapter, which gives characters different appearances in room descriptions depending on when we happen to look; because of the action of the play, we want to show the chorus and audience doing different things during different scenes.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about the chorus during Parodos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The chorus are dancing and singing their way[if the time since Parodos began is less than 3 minutes] up the long walkways onto the stage[otherwise] into position in the orchestra[end if]. [The audience] appear to be pricing their costumes to the nearest obol: woe to the producer who cheats them of their due share of spectacle.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now a scene in which the player can talk several times to a character (Heracles) but has no useful dialogue with the chorus, the audience, or himself. The prohibition from talking to the audience after the Prologue is already written, but we'll supply some appropriate responses for talking to the player or the chorus during this scene:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 3 - Episode
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Episode is a scene. Episode begins when Parodos ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Episode begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move Heracles to the theater;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The chorus falls silent, which is the cue: Heracles bursts out of the scene building.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Heracles is a man. The description is &quot;Hard to mistake in his lion skin and boots, and carrying a formidable club.&quot; Heracles wears a lion skin and boots. He carries a formidable club. Heracles can be placid or annoyed. Heracles is placid. Heracles can be satisfied, intrigued, or unsatisfied. Heracles is unsatisfied.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to the chorus during Episode:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your improvised flirtation with the chorus raises no response but a crude gesture from the chorus-leader, who seems to be modeling the role on Iambe.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to the player during Episode:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Heracles is annoyed

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You mutter to yourself about men with more appetite than brain. The actor playing Heracles ignores you, but it's good odds he's scowling under his mask. He hates it when anyone but himself ad-libs for attention.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Heracles is annoyed;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'By the dog, he'll eat me if he gets a chance,' you mutter aside. [paragraph break]'What's that you say, my ignoble friend?' demands Heracles, hefting his club. He's not entirely joking: you've left the script just now.&quot;;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Episodic Events
<br>output
<br>&quot;With a fart and a roar, Heracles asks the world at large, and you in particular, where his dinner might be.&quot;
<br>&quot;In epic diction, Heracles invites the dairy-mistresses, whey-matrons, and concubines of curd to supply him a supper from their ample baskets.&quot;
<br>&quot;Heracles and the chorus banter about the proclivities of cheese-wives. The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak.&quot;
<br>&quot;Heracles boasts that a man like himself can perform any feat, but only when his belly is full. Coyly, the matrons prance and dance, skip and gambol out of his grasp, singing mockingly about heads of garlic and loaves of sesame-crusted bread.&quot;
<br>&quot;The song of the feta fanciers now turns to pots of honey and new-made wine, borrowing verses from last year's Lenaia winner, 'The Bees'. With a jolt, you realize that you've missed your cue and the chorus are filling in for you.&quot;
<br>&quot;Playing for time, the chorus-leader elaborates a whole banquet: rabbit stew, shanks of lamb, spitted quails, eels from lake Copais. Heracles looks as near swooning as any girl fresh from Brauron.&quot;
<br>&quot;The chorus-leader extends the list of delicacies to include ox-brains, ham-hocks, barley, mullet, carrots, pigeons, lentils, radishes, peas, and apples both wine-dark and golden. The audience shifts on the benches. An expression of gloom settles over the Priest of Dionysus in the front row.&quot;
<br>&quot;Inspired by Euripides['] own Muse, the chorus-leader invents a mock-Alcaean hymn on the merits of chervil. This is clearly his swan-song: if you don't speak at last, the play will come to a halt.&quot;
<br>&quot;Silence descends.&quot;
