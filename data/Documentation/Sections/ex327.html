Conditions and questions</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>A variety of &quot;conditions&quot; have already appeared in this documentation. A condition is a phrase which describes a situation which might be true, or might be false, and examples might include:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Kite is in Bishopsgate
<br>the score is greater than 10
<br>Sherlock Holmes suspects a woman
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These are all examples of sentences, formed by putting nouns either side of a verb, and clearly a wide range of conditions can be written this way. But there are also a few special conditions built into Inform which have a fixed wording, and test questions difficult to address with ordinary sentences. For instance, the condition
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">in darkness
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(e.g., &quot;if in darkness...&quot;) tests whether the player is currently in the dark, and this is better than the more obvious-looking
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the player is in a dark room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since the player might have a torch, or be inside a cage which is itself in a dark room, and so on. Another example of a condition not easily written as a sentence is
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">player consents
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(e.g., &quot;if the player consents...&quot;) which is unusual in doing something and not simply making a silent check: it waits for the player to type YES (or Y) or NO (or N) at the keyboard.
<p>
<p>The outcome of conditions can be stored with the special kind of value called &quot;truth state&quot;. In a way, these are the simplest of all values, because they can only be &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. We can obtain the truth state of any condition using &quot;whether or not...&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let victory be whether or not all the treasures are in the cabinet;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can then examine a truth state by comparing it against true or false:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if victory is true, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Truth state&quot; is a kind of value like any other, so for instance we could define a variable like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Salvation earned is a truth state that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and it can similarly be used in table columns, and anywhere else where values are allowed.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want to ask the player a question where he might say yes or no in response. There are two possible forms of this: the modal question where the player must pick one to proceed, and the non-modal question where he might also type other verbs.
