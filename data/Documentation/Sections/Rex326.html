<p>
<p>Occasionally we would like to change the way the name of something is printed as part of our inventory, and we can do this with a printing the name rule such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the dead rat while taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;dead rat (at arm's length)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are also several possibilities for redesigning the inventory list as a whole. <b>INVENTORY listing with separate carried and worn items</b> shows how to divide an inventory list into two parts, a &quot;You are carrying: &quot; section and a &quot;You are wearing: &quot; section. <b>Equipment List</b> goes further, and shows how we might use Inform's specialized listing functions to create a variety of differently formatted inventories.
<p>
<p><b>Trying Taking Manhattan</b> replaces the inventory behavior for other characters: instead of silently looking through their possessions (but not describing them to the player), they now describe to the player what they're carrying and wearing.

<p>
<p>Most of the phrase options above are relatively self-explanatory; a few are less so. Here is an overview:
<p>
<p>&quot;With newlines&quot; tells Inform to put a new line before each listed object. Indented tells it to indent contents of objects, when listing these.
<p>
<p>&quot;Giving inventory information&quot; means to append information such as (closed) or (being worn) to objects.
<p>
<p>&quot;As a sentence&quot; means to put &quot;and&quot; before the last object and commas between them; this is usually not used in conjunction with newline listing. &quot;As a sentence&quot; obeys whatever conventions about the use of the serial comma we may have established with the &quot;Use serial comma&quot; option.
<p>
<p>&quot;Including contents&quot; means to list the contents of open or transparent containers and all supporters, whereas including all contents means to list the contents of all containers, even opaque closed ones.
<p>
<p>&quot;Tersely&quot;, perhaps unexpectedly, puts parentheses around objects listed as the contents of other objects.
<p>
<p>&quot;Giving brief inventory information&quot; omits most of the inventory tags, such as &quot;(open)&quot; and &quot;(worn)&quot;, but does list &quot;(closed)&quot; for closed containers which might not otherwise be obviously openable.
<p>
<p>&quot;Using the definite article&quot; means prefixing objects with &quot;the&quot;, if applicable, rather than &quot;a&quot;.
<p>
<p>&quot;Listing marked items only&quot; means including only objects that have already been declared &quot;marked for listing&quot;.
<p>
<p>&quot;Prefacing with is-are&quot; means that Inform will write &quot;is&quot; before the list if it contains only one item, and &quot;are&quot; if the list contains more than one.
<p>
<p>&quot;Not listing concealed items&quot; means to omit from the list anything which is scenery.
<p>
<p>Finally, &quot;with extra indentation&quot; means that the whole list should be indented slightly, in emulation of the default inventory listing.
<p>
<p>With this information, we can try rewriting the inventory behavior to emulate the standard or to explore alternate versions:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We begin by emulating the standard inventory listing style:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory when current inventory listing style is tall:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say &quot;You are empty-handed.&quot; instead;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we offer the alternative of listing everything together as a paragraph:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory when current inventory listing style is wide:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say &quot;You are empty-handed.&quot; instead;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list the contents of the player, giving inventory information, as a sentence, including contents;

<p>
<p>This may be unsatisfactory, however. Items that are inside other items are not set off from those merely carried by the player.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory when current inventory listing style is curt:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If, using the above style, we close the sack, we will still get &quot;(closed)&quot; after the sack's listing. The following minimalist listing style abolishes even that nicety:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory when current inventory listing style is minimal:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we want to list worn things separately from carried things, we have occasion to put &quot;listing marked items only&quot; to work:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory when the current inventory listing style is divided wide:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say &quot;You are empty-handed.&quot; instead;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now all things worn by the player are marked for listing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no things are marked for listing begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;nothing&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list the contents of the player, as a sentence, listing marked items only;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;

<p>
<p>And similarly for a tall divided inventory:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory when the current inventory listing style is divided tall:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say &quot;You are empty-handed.&quot; instead;
