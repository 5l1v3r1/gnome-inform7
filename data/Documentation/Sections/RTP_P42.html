<b>P42 - The list-writer has run out of memory</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

The list-writer is the mechanism which prints lists of objects, for instance from the text substitution <font color="#000080"><b>[list of open doors]</b></font> or as part of a room description. It has enough memory to cope with lists holding every object there is, plus a little more besides, but if you try to print a list where every term for some reason lists substantial further lists as part of its own text, it's possible to overwhelm the list-writer. That seems to have happened here: sorry.
