<b>P38 - Attempt to ignore the turn sequence rules</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

Using a procedural rule to ignore the turn sequence rulebook would cause the story file to hang, that is, to remain indefinitely in an unresponsive state. (This wasn't always true: until February 2008, the turn sequence rules did not include command parsing and action generation, so that a form of play could continue even without the turn sequence rulebook. Now, however, more delicate control is needed to achieve such effects: usually putting new rules into the turn sequence rulebook at strategic points to end it early.)
