<p>
<p>Fire exhibits some of the properties of a gas: it is only vaguely located and tends to spread out, though it passes by touch rather than on the air. It is hazardous to life, through direct contact, heat, and smoke. Better governed, it provides light and warmth. Worse governed, it consumes almost anything it comes into contact with. Here the problem with &quot;debris&quot; is not so much that we need potentially hundreds of new objects to represent broken items: instead, fire could sweep through a work of IF destroying so much that no play is possible any longer. Setting up a problem in which the player must defeat a fully-capable fire is difficult to balance.
<p>
<p>As with liquids, it is best to simulate the least amount of fire that the design will allow. <b>Bruneseau's Journey</b> provides a single candle which can be lit, or blown out, but where fire can never transfer from the candle's end to anything else - or vice versa: the player's source of fire, with which to light the candle, is discreetly neglected.
<p>
<p>In the more realistic <b>Thirst 2</b>, a campfire is lit using a tinderbox, so that fire does transfer from one thing (tinder) to another (the campfire): but it is always confined to just these two items, and can be used only for light and warmth.
<p>
<p><b>The Cow Exonerated</b> provides a class of matches that can light any flammable object, but assumes that burning objects requires only one turn; lighting one thing does not burn another.
<p>
<p><b>In Fire or in Flood</b> provides a complete simulation of what we might call &quot;wild-fire&quot;: combustion which spreads through arbitrary objects and rooms, destroying all in its path.

<p>
<p>
<p>But that's only a small part of the battle. The thing about fire is that it keeps on doing fiery things even when the player is otherwise occupied: destroying items that are on fire, and spreading to other things nearby. So we need a set of rules for the fire's behavior.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when something is flaming:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the fire rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fire rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule (this is the can't hold flaming objects rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through flaming things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is held by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let turns remaining be the endurance of the item minus the turns of burning of the item;

<p>
<p>Because we've labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual. For instance, if there were a pair of fireproof gloves in the game, we might want to turn off the &quot;can't hold flaming objects rule&quot; whenever the player is wearing them.
<p>
<p>This sort of flexibility is especially useful in the context of extensions. Someone writing an extension about burning would have no way of anticipating the need for a Fireproof Gauntlet of Thog, but the author would nonetheless be able to implement one easily.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is vulnerable if it is flammable and it is whole.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The contact between things is a critical factor when it comes to fire, so we might add a couple of conditional relations do determine what is touching what.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be relying on implies the reliance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is relying on Y or Y is relying on X. The verb to be joined to implies the contact relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Having these at our disposal makes it much tidier to write what happens next:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To spread the flames from (item - a thing):
