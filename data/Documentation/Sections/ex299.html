Making reciprocal relations</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>The relationships described in this chapter so far are by no means always reciprocated. For instance, if a stone is on a table, then it is never true that the table is also on the stone. And the question may not even be meaningful to ask. If Peter wears a jacket, the jacket does not even have the possibility of wearing Peter.
<p>
<p>But sometimes we do want a relation which works both ways equally well. These are simple to set up:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Meeting relates people to each other.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect is that various people know various other people, and this is always reciprocated. If Daisy knows Sophie then, automatically, Sophie knows Daisy. This even-handedness is maintained throughout play, so that whatever changes are made it is always true that if A knows B then B knows A.
<p>
<p>And similarly for a reciprocal relation between one and another:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage relates one person to another.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In this case, we can again give a name to the partner under a relation:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage relates one person to another (called the spouse).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and now, for instance, we may have that the spouse of John is Yoko and the spouse of Yoko is John.
<p>
<p>Since many of these examples have involved people, it might be worth mentioning again that any kind can be involved, not just the &quot;person&quot; kind.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check calling it on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not a telephone, say &quot;[The second noun] is unlikely to be much use in that respect.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is the noun, say &quot;You get a busy signal.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out calling it on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a person (called the listener) can see the noun, now the player reaches the listener.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because we've said that connection is a reciprocal, one-to-one relationship, Inform will do the rest of the bookkeeping: if (for instance) we telephone someone else, the first connection will be broken automatically.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report calling it on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Hello?' says [the other party of the player].&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To avoid annoyance, we should also let the player use CALL #### as well as CALL #### ON TELEPHONE. A rule from Chapter 16 comes in handy here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing second noun while calling something on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assign a phone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To assign a phone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player can touch a telephone (called the current phone)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(on [the current phone])[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the second noun to the current phone;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You don't have a phone handy.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Things might be a little more complicated if we had cell phones that could be moved around, but for right now the player can only touch a maximum of one phone at a time.
<p>
<p>Suppose we further want to allow the player to call people up by name, but only if they've already been encountered or are familiar to the player for some reason.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person can be known or unknown.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;call [any known person] on [something]&quot; as calling it by name on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing second noun while calling something by name on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assign a phone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Calling it by name on is an action applying to one visible thing and one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check calling it by name on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is in the location, say &quot;[The noun] is right here.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out calling it by name on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun can touch a telephone (called the link), try calling the link on the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You can't reach [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before calling something on something when the player reaches someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first ending your conversation with [the other party of the player])[command clarification break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end current conversation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;hang up [something]&quot; as hanging up.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Hanging up is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check hanging up:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not a telephone, say &quot;You can't hang up [the noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player does not reach someone, say &quot;You're not on the line with anyone.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hanging up:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player does not reach anyone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report hanging up:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You put down [the noun], cutting the connection.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first hanging up on [the other party of the player])[command clarification break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end current conversation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally we want to make sure that calling random other numbers produces a sensible result:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;call [text]&quot; as misdialling. Misdialling is an action applying to one topic. Carry out misdialling: say &quot;The phone rings and rings but no one answers.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;call 911&quot; or &quot;call 999&quot; or &quot;call police&quot; or &quot;call fire department&quot; as a mistake (&quot;After strict warnings, you've given up making prank calls to emergency services.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before misdialling when the player reaches someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first ending your conversation with [the other party of the player])[command clarification break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end current conversation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To end current conversation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the current phone be a random telephone which can be touched by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try hanging up the current phone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while the player reaches someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place the other party of the player in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Conversation over the Phone, In General
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This portion supplies a simple method of conversation; but we could substitute some completely different conversation system if appropriate. The effect of the telephones is that we are allowed to talk to characters in distant locations under certain circumstances, after which the usual conversation rules apply.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening to a telephone when the player reaches someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can hear [the other party of the player] breathing.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listening to someone when the player cannot touch the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is waiting for you to carry on the conversation.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a table-name called chatter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before telling someone about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try asking the noun about it instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before answering someone that something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Best to confine your conversation to questions and answers.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before asking someone about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the topic understood is a topic listed in the chatter of the noun, say &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;[The noun] does not reply.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 3 - The Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Guard House is a room. &quot;Here you spend all your nights. Bullet-proof windows offer a panoramic view of serene cliffs, palm trees, and a moonlit ocean. Occasionally someone is foolish enough to try a cliff ascent or even an attack by helicopter, but lately things have been pretty quiet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The mansion is up the hill behind you, security lights ablaze.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The grey telephone is a telephone in the Guard House. Understand &quot;6885&quot; as the grey telephone. &quot;Before you is a grey telephone. In black marker someone has written on it: MAIN OFFICE 2802.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going a direction in the Guard House, say &quot;And leave your post? The boss would have you flayed. No kidding.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In a game where the player could walk around, we would of course want to add a before rule so that he automatically hung up any phone he was using before leaving the room.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Main Office is a room. The boss is a known woman in the Main Office. A telephone called the red telephone is in the Main Office. Understand &quot;2802&quot; as the red telephone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Guild is a room. The ninja is an unknown man in the Guild. A telephone called the black telephone is in the Guild. Understand &quot;4431&quot; as the black telephone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Potter's Pizza is a room. The pizza delivery boy is a known man in Pizza. A telephone called the saucy telephone is in Pizza. Understand &quot;8885&quot; as the saucy telephone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The chatter of the boss is the Table of Boss Conversation. The chatter of the delivery boy is the Table of Pizza Conversation. The chatter of the ninja is the Table of Ninja Conversation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After calling the red telephone on something for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Yes?' asks the boss. Her voice is especially husky this evening. Maybe that night of passion isn't so far off after all.&quot;
