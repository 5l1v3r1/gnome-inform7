<body><font size=2><b>Translating the Source - Failed</b><p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, but the compiler unexpectedly halted with a fatal error.
<p>
<center><img src=crash.png border=0></center>
<p>
Fatal errors are usually the result of a problem with the file-system, but it is unlikely that your computer is at fault. More likely causes are:
<p>
<UL TYPE=SQUARE><LI>disc space running out on the volume holding the project;</LI>
<LI>trying to run a project from a read-only volume, such as a burned CD or DVD;</LI>
<LI>trying to run a project which belongs to another user, whose files you have no permission to alter.</UL>
</LI></UL>
<p>
However, if you think it more likely that the Inform 7 compiler is at fault, please check that you have the currently distributed build of the system: if you have, please consider taking the time to fill out a bug report form and email it to the author.
<p>
<center><b>Sorry for the inconvenience.</b></center>
