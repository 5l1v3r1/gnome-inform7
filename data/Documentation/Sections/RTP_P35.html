<b>P35 - File being read has too many rows or columns to fit into table</b>

The contents of tables can be saved into disc files and subsequently loaded in again, perhaps on a different run, or even into the same table but in a different project. Here, I tried to load in such a file, but it contained more rows or columns than the total number available in the table which was supposed to hold it.
