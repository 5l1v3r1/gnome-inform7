<p>
<p>If we have declared a new activity, like &quot;analysing&quot;, the normal way to make it happen would be to write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which goes through the whole machinery of rules - before, for, after - and then resumes, the activity having started, taken place and come to an end.
<p>
<p>But there are times when it is not convenient to write a suitable &quot;for ...&quot; rule, or where we need more control, and do not wish to hand the whole business over to a single phrase. For such times we are allowed to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">begin the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>...
<br>end the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This time the activity is ongoing throughout as many phrases as we care to write between the &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;. The before rules are considered at the time of the &quot;begin ...&quot; phrase; the after rules at the &quot;end ...&quot;. What, then, of the &quot;for&quot; rules? In the above setup, they would simply be ignored. But we can make them effectual like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">begin the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>...
<br>if handling the analysing activity with the pitchblende:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>...
<br>end the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;for&quot; rules are invoked when the &quot;handling ...&quot; test is carried out: the condition is true only if no rule has intervened. Thus we should place the activity's normal behaviour inside the &quot;if&quot;.
<p>
<p>It is also legal to force an early end to an activity with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">abandon the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This can only be done with an activity which has had its &quot;begin&quot; but not yet its &quot;end&quot;; it is a drastic remedy best taken only if it is clear that circumstances have changed so that the activity now seems inappropriate. It must not be used during one of the rules for the activity: it can only be used between the begin and for stages, or between the for and end stages.
<p>
<p>We need to follow three golden rules: all activities must end, they must never last longer than a turn, and if activity B starts during activity A then it must also finish during activity A. We must also be careful to make sure that if an activity applies to something, then it begins and ends with the same something (the pitchblende, in the above example).
