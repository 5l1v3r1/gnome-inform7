<p>The simplest form of clock is a wrist watch. Here is a choice of analogue or digital:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a wrist watch. The description of the wrist watch is &quot;It is [the time of day in words].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a digital watch. The description of the digital watch is &quot;It is [the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Better clocks would allow us also to set the time, and to stop and start them: see <b>Tom's Midnight Garden</b>.
<p>
<p>Scientific instruments provide sharper versions of our own senses. In the case of vision, they allow us to see closer up, or further away. It's a convention of IF that people can normally see only the current location, that is, they cannot see from one location into another. The boundary of the current room is like a horizon, even out of doors (though it's true that there are ways to disguise that with a continuous outdoor landscape). <b>Ginger Beer</b> provides a telescope able to see into other rooms.
<p>
<p><b>Witnessed 2</b> provides a meter which measures how close a ghost is to the player.

<p>Suppose we want to have a pair of linked lenses so that the player can look into one of them and see things which occur in room containing the other lense.
<p>
<p>We begin simply with a bit of environment for the player to wander around:

<p>
<p>Now for the lenses themselves:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A lense is a kind of thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The large end of the telescope is a lense in the Ginger Beer Factory.  &quot;There is a large glass lense propped against the wall, in which are reflected all the contents of the room.&quot;  Understand &quot;glass&quot; or &quot;lense&quot; as the large end.

The description is &quot;A gleaming lense about the size of a pound coin.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here is the critical bit, which needs to be somewhat flexible, since the large end of the telescope could in theory be left anywhere in the game (and should still work).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while the small end is carried by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let there be the holder of the large end;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place there in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before searching the small end when the small end is not carried by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first picking up [the small end] and holding it to your eye)&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the small end.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching the small end when the player is not carrying the small end:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It's too hard to look through the small end from a distance.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching the large end,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You see only your own reflection.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We also want to make sure that the player who looks through the small lense does not see the large lense listed among the contents of the other location:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is recognizable if it is not a lense.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching the small end:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the far side be the holder of the large end of the telescope;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You peer into the little lense and through it see, in [the far side], [the list of recognizable things in the far side].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine lense / south / examine lense / look through lense / north / look through small lense&quot;.
