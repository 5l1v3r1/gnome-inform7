<p>Just as Inform normally assumes everything is solid, it also assumes that these solid objects will not buckle, crack, break or deform under pressure, and cannot be fragmented. But breakability adds realism, and breakage need not be negative: sometimes we want the player to break her way in to something.
<p>
<p>In IF the word DROP is more often used to mean &quot;put down&quot; or &quot;leave behind&quot; than &quot;let go from a height&quot;: so it is perhaps unfair that in <b>Ming Vase</b> something fragile, when dropped, shatters (into nothing). In <b>Spring Cleaning</b>, fragile objects must be explicitly attacked by the player in order to break, and although they leave no tangible debris behind, their loss is at least remembered. <b>Kyoto</b> provides a general-purpose model for things being thrown at other things, with consequences including things moving (even between rooms) as well as breaking each other.
<p>
<p>Debris from breakages is to be avoided if possible because it means keeping track of increasing numbers of objects. But we can increase realism by allowing something to have a visibly &quot;broken&quot; state, which it changes to when it breaks, rather than simply vanishing. <b>Terracottissima</b> provides for broken and unbroken flowerpots in this way.
<p>
<p>Since &quot;part of&quot; allows us to have two objects joined together into what the player sees as one, it also gives us a natural seam which allows the whole to be broken back down into its component parts, and this is the neatest way of providing a breakage into pieces. <b>Paddington</b> demonstrates a cutting action which allows component parts to be cut away from their holders but will only make small surface gashes in any individual thing: so the player can cut something up, but only into the pieces we specifically choose to allow. Cutting also forces an opening into containers.

<p>Suppose we want to expand the function of the existing THROW SOMETHING AT command so that a thrown object actually does make contact most of the time. A glance at the Actions index tells us that the Throwing it at rulebook currently looks like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Throwing something at something (past tense thrown it at)

<p>
<p>Some of those still look useful. We want to leave the &quot;implicitly remove thrown clothing&quot; rule, for instance -- no fair having the player throw a hat that's on his head. On the other hand, the &quot;futile to throw things at inanimate objects rule&quot; is going to have to go, because that would prevent us from ever being able to complete the throwing command. So let's get rid of that:

<p>
<p>That &quot;block throwing at&quot; rule also looks sinister: any &quot;block...&quot; rule in the standard actions library is there to print a message telling the player he can't do what he's asked to do.
<p>
<p>But it's not enough to ignore it, the way we did the &quot;futile&quot; rule. Since we are only expanding the command to affect inanimate objects, let's replace the &quot;block throwing at&quot; rule with a different one which will only prevent the player throwing things at people:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The block throwing at people rule is listed instead of the block throwing at rule in the check throwing it at rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the block throwing at people rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is a person, say &quot;That might be construed as an attack.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we've changed the command so that some action can sometimes be carried out here -- but we don't have any rules for what happens. It's time to create some rules for our model world.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be hard or soft. A thing can be fragile or strong. Shape is a kind of value. The shapes are round, flat, and linear. A thing has shape.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we're actually going to allow throwing, we might want to add a couple of extra checks to the rulebook to make sure that this happens when it ought:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check throwing it at (this is the block juggling rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is carrying the second noun, say &quot;It would be difficult to throw at something you are yourself holding.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check throwing it at (this is the avoid throwing things into themselves rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is within the noun, say &quot;That would be a nice magic trick.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And then the rules for the action itself:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out throwing it at (this is the check aerodynamics rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is flat:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move noun to location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun], unwieldy, flutters to the ground.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That &quot;rule succeeds&quot; ends the action here, if the noun is flat. If not, Inform goes on to the next rule in the carry out throwing it at rulebook:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out throwing it at (this is the contact rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] hits [the second noun].[paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is fragile and the noun is hard:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out throwing it at (this is the landing rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let destination be the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is on a supporter (called endtable), let destination be the endtable;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is a supporter, let destination be the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the destination;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is fragile and the second noun is hard:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] lands [if the destination is the location]nearby[otherwise]on [the destination][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These rules are assuming some backup information, so let's provide that as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be relying on implies the reliance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To destroy (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let home be the holder of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is part of something (called the superstructure), let home be the holder of the superstructure;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The item] breaks[if something is relying on the item], leaving [a list of things which are relying on the item] behind[end if].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something is relying on the item,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now all the things which are relying on the item are in the home;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the item from play.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now suppose we'd like to add some further cases for what happens if the player breaks a fragile door this way:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To destroy (item - a door):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the item to open;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the item to unopenable;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The item] smashes.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of an unopenable open door while not throwing something at something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;open doorway&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;door&quot; or &quot;doorway&quot; as a door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This works, except that objects will continue to &quot;strike&quot; open, unopenable doors, with the result that the player can smash the same door over and over. What we need is another rule, after the aerodynamics rule and before the contact rule, that tells Inform how to handle throwing things at open doors.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the flying through doorways rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is an open door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the distant room be the other side of the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the distant room;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] flies out of sight into [the distant room].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If the original rulebook is one we wrote ourselves, we could just add that rule in the proper spot in order. If we got it from an extension, though, we might need to put it in the right place explicitly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The flying through doorways rule is listed before the contact rule in the carry out throwing it at rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The magic of rulebooks is that they allow authors to amend each other's work (or the Standard Rules) with a fair amount of freedom. A well-written extension will give individual names to its rules, to allow subsequent authors to modify the function of the extension without too much trouble.
<p>
<p>Now for an actual scenario with which to test this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Part 2 - The Study
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sliding paper screen is a door. It is north of the Moss Garden and south of the Study. The paper screen is fragile.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a netsuke and a shamisen. The description of the netsuke is &quot;A weight for the cord on which you wear your purse or your medicine box. This particular one has the shape of a bullfrog, carved from green stone.&quot; The netsuke is round, hard, and strong. Understand &quot;green&quot; or &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;bullfrog&quot; as the netsuke.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the shamisen is &quot;An instrument you have only begun to learn to play.&quot; The shamisen is linear, soft, and fragile. A neck is part of the shamisen. The neck is linear, strong, and hard. A body is part of the shamisen. The body is round, fragile, and soft. A string is part of the shamisen. The string is linear, soft, and strong. The printed name of the body is &quot;[if the body is not part of the shamisen]shamisen [end if]body&quot;. The printed name of the neck is &quot;[if the neck is not part of the shamisen]shamisen [end if]neck&quot;. Understand &quot;shamisen&quot; as the body when the body is not part of the shamisen. Understand &quot;shamisen&quot; as the neck when the neck is not part of the shamisen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the Study is &quot;A restful three-tatami room.&quot; The Study contains a calligraphy box and a hanging scroll. The initial appearance of the hanging scroll is &quot;A handsome scroll depicts two women in kimonos crossing a bridge; Mount Fuji is in the background.&quot; The calligraphy box contains a brush. The box is openable and closed. The brush is hard, linear, and strong. The calligraphy box is round, soft, and strong. The hanging scroll is flat, soft, and strong.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the Moss Garden is &quot;Earlier today, you arranged three leaves on the moss in imitation of autumn. They must not be disturbed.&quot; The leaves are scenery in the Moss Garden. Instead of throwing something at the leaves: say &quot;You spent too long over their placement.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;test one / test two&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test one with &quot;open screen / throw netsuke at screen / n / get netsuke / close screen / get scroll / throw scroll at screen / throw netsuke at scroll / get netsuke / throw netsuke at shamisen / drop netsuke&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test two with &quot;throw shamisen at netsuke / get all / throw netsuke at screen / get netsuke / throw netsuke at door / s / get netsuke&quot;.
