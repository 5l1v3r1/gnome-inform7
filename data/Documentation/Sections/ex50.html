<p>
<p>We come at last to the final thing which can be specified about an action, and appropriately enough it must be specified with the final words of the description. This is the way to talk about repeated activity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the tapestry for the third time, say &quot;All right, so it's a masterpiece, but is this really the time to make a detailed study?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the urn at least twice, say &quot;It's an urn. What do you want from me?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going nowhere for the 20th time, say &quot;Do stop walking into walls, there's a good fellow.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we are allowed to spell out numbers up to ten in English words, but beyond that must use digits (thus &quot;tenth&quot; is allowed but not &quot;eleventh&quot;: &quot;11th&quot; should be used instead). The following example is instructive:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something for the fourth time, say &quot;No. I'm capricious.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This means that it is the fourth time a &quot;taking...&quot; action has been tried, and does not mean that the same item was taken each time. Also, note that we are counting the number of times the action has been tried, not the number of times it succeeded.

<p>The following is an almost-completely-faithful rewrite of Emily Short's &quot;A Day for Fresh Sushi&quot;, which was originally written using the (very different) Inform 6 programming language. The -- let us be honest and call it a gimmick -- of this game is the evil fish, who has some unpleasant remark to offer on pretty much every action. But the effect would wear off fast if he repeated himself, so these comments need to be single-use only.
<p>
<p>Inform 7's repeated action syntax makes it much tidier to write the same scenario, so:

[=0x0022=][if visited]Decorated with Britney[=0x0027=]s signature flair. It was her innate sense of style that first made you forgive her that ludicrous name. And here it is displayed to the fullest: deep-hued drapes on the walls, the windows flung open with their stunning view of old Vienna, the faint smell of coffee that clings to everying. Her easel stands over by the windows, where the light is brightest.[otherwise]This is Britney[=0x0027=]s studio. You haven[=0x0027=]t been around here for a while, because of how busy you[=0x0027=]ve been with work, and she[=0x0027=]s made a few changes -- the aquarium in the corner, for instance. But it still brings back a certain emotional sweetness from the days when you had just met for the first time... when you used to spend hours on the sofa...[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]You shake your head. No time for fantasy. Must feed fish.[end if][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of smelling the Studio:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]The evil fish notices you sniffing the air. [=0x0027=]Vanilla Raspberry Roast,[=0x0027=] it remarks. [=0x0027=]You really miss her, don[=0x0027=]t you.[=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]You glance over, startled, but the fish[=0x0027=]s mouth is open in a piscine equivalent of a laugh. You stifle the urge to skewer the thing...[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of jumping:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Er,[=0x0027=] says the fish. [=0x0027=]Does that, like, EVER help??[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of going nowhere:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]You can[=0x0027=]t leave until you[=0x0027=]ve fed the fish. Otherwise, he[=0x0027=]ll complain, and you will never hear the end of it.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The cabinet is an openable closed container in the Studio. It is fixed in place. [=0x0022=]A huge cabinet, in the guise of an armoire, stands between the windows.[=0x0022=] The description is [=0x0022=]Large, and with a bit of an Art Nouveau theme going on in the shape of the doors.[=0x0022=] Understand [=0x0022=]armoire[=0x0022=] as the cabinet.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of looking under the cabinet for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Dustbunnies,[=0x0027=] predicts the fish, with telling accuracy. It executes what for all the world looks like a fishy shudder. [=0x0027=]Lemme tell you, one time I accidentally flopped outta the tank, and I was TWO HOURS on the floor with those things STARING ME IN THE NOSE. It was frightening.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After opening the cabinet for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]There ya go,[=0x0027=] says the fish. [=0x0027=]The girl is getting WARMER.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After closing the cabinet for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the fish food is not found, say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Ooh, what do you think, Bob? I think we[=0x0027=]re going to have to dock the girl a few points. HAVE ANOTHER LOOK, sweetcakes, there[=0x0027=]s a doll.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The cabinet contains some paints and some cloths. The description of the paints is [=0x0022=]A bunch of tubes of oil paint, most of them in some state of grunginess, some with the tops twisted partway off.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After taking the paints for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Boy,[=0x0027=] says the fish, apparently to himself, [=0x0027=]I sure hope that[=0x0027=]s some food she[=0x0027=]s finding for me in there. You know, the yummy food in the ORANGE CAN.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After examining the paints for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Tons of useful stuff in there,[=0x0027=] hollers in the fish, in a syncopated burble.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the cloths is [=0x0022=]Various colors of drapery that Britney uses to set up backgrounds and clothe her models. She does a lot of portraiture, so this comes in handy. It[=0x0027=]s all a big messy wad at the moment. Organized is not her middle name.[=0x0022=] Understand [=0x0022=]drapery[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]cloth[=0x0022=] as the cloths. The indefinite article of the cloths is [=0x0022=]a heap of[=0x0022=]. [see 3.17][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of searching or looking under the cloths for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]now the player is carrying the fish food;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]now the fish food is found;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Poking around the cloths reveals -- ha HA! -- a vehemently orange can of fish food.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of showing the cloths to the fish:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]What are you, some kind of sadist? I don[=0x0027=]t want to see a bunch of cloths! What kind of f[=0x0027=]ing good, [=0x0027=]scuse my French, is that supposed to do me? I don[=0x0027=]t even wear pants for God[=0x0027=]s sake![=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]He really looks upset. You start wondering whether apoplexy is an ailment common to fish.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After examining cloths for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Whatcha looking at? I can[=0x0027=]t see through the doors, you know.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The can of fish food is a thing. Understand [=0x0022=]canister[=0x0022=] as the can. The description is [=0x0022=]A vehemently orange canister of fish food.[=0x0022=] The fish food can be found or hidden. The fish food is hidden.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of giving the can to the fish:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]I don[=0x0027=]t want the whole can, GeniusChyk. Just feed me and we[=0x0027=]ll ALL be happy, [=0x0027=]kay?[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of showing the can to the fish:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]That[=0x0027=]s the ticket, sweetie! Bring it on.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of opening the can:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Oh, for--![=0x0027=] The evil fish breaks out in exasperation and hives. [=0x0027=]Screw the screwing around with the screwtop. SHE never has to do that.[=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Well, SHE is not here,[=0x0027=] you reply. [=0x0027=]What do you suggest?[=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=][=0x003E=]FEED FISH[=0x003C=][=0x0027=] says the fish promptly, making fishy faces and pointing at you with his fin. [=0x0027=]Simplicity. Try it.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of inserting the can into something:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]HelLLLOOO,[=0x0027=] screams the fish. [=0x0027=]Whatever happened to FEEDING MEEE?[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The easel is a supporter in the Studio. It is scenery. On the easel is a painting. Understand [=0x0022=]portrait[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]image[=0x0022=] as the painting.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the painting is [=0x0022=]Only partway finished, but you can tell what it is: Britney[=0x0027=]s mother. You only met the old woman once, before she faded out of existence in a little hospice in Salzburg.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]In the picture, her hands are grasping tightly at a small grey bottle, the pills to which she became addicted in her old age, and strange, gargoyle-like forms clutch at her arms and whisper in her ears.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]But the disturbing thing, the truly awful thing, is the small figure of Britney herself, down in the corner, unmistakable: she is walking away. Her back turned.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]You thought she[=0x0027=]d finally talked this out, but evidently not. Still feels guilty for leaving. You only barely stop yourself from tracing, with your finger, those tiny slumped shoulders...[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of taking the painting, say [=0x0022=]No, you[=0x0027=]d better leave it. It[=0x0027=]d freak her out if you moved it.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Before examining the painting for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]A ferocious banging from the aquarium attracts your attention as you go to look at the painting. [=0x0027=]Hey![=0x0027=] screams the fish. [=0x0027=]She doesn[=0x0027=]t like strangers looking at her paintings before they[=0x0027=]re DOONNNE![=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Shut up, you,[=0x0027=] you reply casually. [=0x0027=]I[=0x0027=]m not a stranger.[=0x0027=] But the fish puts you off a little bit, and your heart is already in your mouth before you see the painting itself...[=0x0022=].[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of examining the painting more than once:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Once is really enough. It[=0x0027=]s pretty much embedded in your consciousness now.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After doing something to the painting:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]So what[=0x0027=]s it of?[=0x0027=] asks the fish, as you turn away. [=0x0027=]She never asks if I want to see them, you know?[=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Her mother,[=0x0027=] you respond without thinking.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Yeah? Man. I never knew my mother. Eggs, that[=0x0027=]s the way to go.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The window is scenery in the Studio. The window can be openable. The window can be open. It is openable and closed. Understand [=0x0022=]windows[=0x0022=] as the window. The description of the window is [=0x0022=][if open]Through the windows you get a lovely view of the street outside. At the moment, the glass is thrown open, and a light breeze is blowing through.[otherwise]Through the windows, you get a lovely view of the street outside -- the little fountain on the corner, the slightly dilapidated but nonetheless magnificent Jugendstil architecture of the facing building. The glass itself is shut, however.[end if][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After opening the window for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Thank god some air,[=0x0027=] says the fish. [=0x0027=]Man, it was getting hard to breathe in here.[=0x0027=] Two beats pass. [=0x0027=]Oh wait.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The table is scenery in the Studio. On the table is a vase. The vase is an open container. It is not openable.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the table is [=0x0022=]A monstrosity of poor taste and bad design: made of some heavy, French-empire sort of wood, with a single pillar for a central leg, carved in the image of Poseidon surrounded by nymphs. It[=0x0027=]s all scaley, and whenever you sit down, the trident has a tendency to stab you in the knee. But Britney assures you it[=0x0027=]s worth a fortune.[=0x0022=] The description of the vase is [=0x0022=]A huge vase -- what you saw once described in a Regency romance as an epergne, maybe -- something so big that it would block someone sitting at the table from seeing anyone else also sitting at the table. But it does function nicely as a receptacle for hugeass bouquets of flowers.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of looking under the table for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]You[=0x0027=]re not going to find anything down there,[=0x0027=] whines the fish. [=0x0027=]I mean, c[=0x0027=]mon. It[=0x0027=]s the fricking floor. Please tell me you can see that. I can see that. I[=0x0027=]m a myopic fish in a tank ten feet away and I can tell you there is nothing there but floor.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After examining the table:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]That there is MY PA,[=0x0027=] says the fish, pointing at the scaley triton figure with one fin.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of inserting something which is not the bouquet into the vase:[=0x000A=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Okay, so, what were you, raised in a barn? Normal folks like to use that for flowers. Or so I[=0x0027=]ve observed.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After inserting the bouquet into the vase for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]You settle the flowers into the vase and arrange them so that they look sprightly.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Oooh,[=0x0027=] says the fish.

It was her innate sense of style that first made you forgive her that ludicrous name. And here it is displayed to the fullest: deep-hued drapes on the walls, the windows flung open with their stunning view of old Vienna, the faint smell of coffee that clings to everying. Her easel stands over by the windows, where the light is brightest.[otherwise]This is Britney's studio. You haven't been around here for a while, because of how busy you've been with work, and she's made a few changes -- the aquarium in the corner, for instance. But it still brings back a certain emotional sweetness from the days when you had just met for the first time... when you used to spend hours on the sofa...

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of looking under the cabinet for the first time:

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before examining the painting for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A ferocious banging from the aquarium attracts your attention as you go to look at the painting. 'Hey!' screams the fish. 'She doesn't like strangers looking at her paintings before they're DOONNNE!'
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'Shut up, you,' you reply casually. 'I'm not a stranger.' But the fish puts you off a little bit, and your heart is already in your mouth before you see the painting itself...&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the painting more than once:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Once is really enough. It's pretty much embedded in your consciousness now.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After doing something to the painting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'So what's it of?' asks the fish, as you turn away. 'She never asks if I want to see them, you know?'

<p>
