<b>P54 - Only things can be moved</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

<p>
Most everyday items in an Inform work are <font color="#000080"><b>things</b></font> - which includes people, containers, vehicles and so on. Those can all move around, at least in theory. The other kinds of object - such as <font color="#000080"><b>room</b></font>, <font color="#000080"><b>region</b></font> and <font color="#000080"><b>direction</b></font> - do not represent portable items, and so can't be moved. An attempt to move them with a line like <font color="#000080"><b>now the Mirror Room is in Versailles</b></font> will cause this problem message.
