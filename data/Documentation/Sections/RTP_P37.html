<b>P37 - Low level error</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

<p>
This indicates that some low-level error has occurred in the template layer, a body of Inform 6 code used to provide run-time support for Inform 7 story files. Errors like this really shouldn't happen, but might occur if you are hacking with the template layer, or if there is a bug in Inform. If you don't seem to be doing anything you shouldn't, please report this to the authors of Inform as a possible bug.
