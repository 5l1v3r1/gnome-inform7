<p>We can also reckon the number of consecutive turns on which an action has been repeated, by talking about &quot;turns&quot; instead of &quot;times&quot;, as demonstrated in the following example game. Note also that we are allowed to use the phrase &quot;doing it&quot; to mean &quot;the same description as the previous one except for the part about turns or times&quot;, like so:

<p>Note once again that numbers above twelve must not be written out, so &quot;more than twelve times&quot; would be acceptable, but we would write &quot;more than 13 times&quot;.
