<p>
<p>Text can also be saved to a file, and again all file-handling is automatic:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">write &quot;Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.&quot; to the file of Abecedary Wisdom;
<br>append &quot;Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt.&quot; to the file of Abecedary Wisdom;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The difference between &quot;write&quot; and &quot;append&quot; here is that &quot;write&quot; makes this text the entire contents of the file, whereas &quot;append&quot; adds it the end (creating the file if it did not previously exist).
<p>
<p>The quoted text can, of course, contain substitutions, so can be long and complex if need be.
<p>
<p>Text from a file is printed back with the text substitution:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;[text of the File of Abecedary Wisdom]&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To copy one file to another, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">write &quot;[text of the file of Abecedary Wisdom]&quot; to the file of Secondary Wisdom;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Some mystery games supply the player with an in-game system for taking notes, in case he doesn't want to rely on scraps of paper next to the computer. One way of doing this is to write out all the player's notes and observations into a notebook file, whose contents can be retrieved during play (or, indeed, after it).
<p>
<p>We'll first invent a general system for writing text into notebooks, by creating a new kind called jotter. Each individual jotter will have its own disc file, and there will be basically three things which can be done with jotters: erasing, reading and writing.
<p>
