New activities</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Activities are all about influencing the standard mechanisms which Inform uses, so it might at first seem that there is no need to create new activities: but on further reflection, quite a lot of the writing of interactive fiction involves creating new and systematic ways to do things, and as soon as we have a general rule, we will want to have exceptions. Inform therefore allows us to create our own activities, giving us ways to influence the operation of our own mechanisms.
<p>
<p>There are two kinds of activity: those which relate to a specific thing or room, and those which do not. The following creates one of each kind:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Analysing something is an activity.
<br>Assaying is an activity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;analysing something&quot; relates to a specific item: Inform knows this because it looks for the clue &quot;something&quot; (or &quot;of something&quot;) after the activity's name, which in the first case above is simply &quot;analysing&quot;.
<p>
<p>Creating an activity is like creating an action: it automatically makes new rulebooks - &quot;before analysing&quot;, &quot;for analysing&quot; and &quot;after analysing&quot; - but they start out empty, so the activity does nothing yet. Just as it does for rulebooks, Inform defines the adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot; for activities to test this state:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the analysing activity is empty, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be true only when all three of its rulebooks are empty.
<p>
<p>Moreover, a newly created activity never happens, unless we take steps to make it do so. We can make an activity happen at any time by writing phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>carry out the assaying activity;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To make the activity do something useful, we need to put a rule into its &quot;for&quot; rulebook:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last for assaying rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Professionally, you cast an eye around mineral deposits nearby, noticing [list of rocks in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The last&quot; is a technicality about rulebooks (see the next chapter) which, put briefly, guarantees that this rule comes last among all possible &quot;for assaying&quot; rules. This is good form because the whole point of an activity is to make it easy for further rules to interfere - so we deliberately hang back to last place, giving precedence to anybody else who wants it.
<p>
<p>It may look rather pretentious to dress up the footling little &quot;assaying&quot; example as an activity, but it gains us more than might first appear. Every new activity created provides a context which other activities can observe. We could, for instance, define
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of a rock while assaying: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that during assays more technical names are used.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want to add rules so that any time we examine a charred object (and most of our objects can be charred), a line about the charring is appended to the end of the object description. We could use &quot;after examining...&quot;, but perhaps we would prefer for the sentence about the charring not to appear in its own paragraph.
<p>
<p>This is an ideal occasion for a new activity. We look at the action index for &quot;examining&quot; to identify the rule that causes the old behavior (in this case, the &quot;standard examining rule&quot;); replace this with a new rule that calls our activity; and write our &quot;printing the description&quot; activity in such a way that it uses an object's description without forcing a paragraph return afterward.
<p>
<p>Then we will use &quot;after printing the description&quot; to add our line about charring, and make sure that the paragraph return does occur before the prompt.
<p>
<p>So:

<p>
<p>All we have done here is enclose what is usually just a rule inside an activity. This means that we can now write before and after rules for the activity, and also add special instructions like &quot;Rule for printing the name of something while printing the description of something&quot; -- this may not be likely to arise often, but Inform now has the concept of &quot;printing the description of something&quot; as a separate context of action. Next we add the modification that lets us append to the description without a new line:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the description of something (called item):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[description of item] [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;run paragraph on&quot; here will mean that we do not get a paragraph break following the description, even if it ends with a period. We also insert a space, so that our follow-on comments will be properly punctuated.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the description of something charred:

<p>
<p>The instead at the end of this line stops Inform for going on with any other &quot;after printing the description of...&quot; rules.
<p>
<p>And now, because we want to make sure that we always do get a paragraph break after our description, we add this rule last after all the other rules. &quot;Last&quot; and &quot;first&quot; rules are covered in more detail in the chapter on rulebooks.
