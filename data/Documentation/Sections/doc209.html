<p>We have already seen, in the chapter on Descriptions which is a forerunner of this one, that Inform provides not only &quot;adjacent&quot; as a way of seeing if one room is directly connected to another, but also &quot;the best route from A to B&quot;, which allows us to see if any sequence of moves connects them.
<p>
<p>Something similar - in fact, simpler - is allowed for any relation. Suppose we would like to go sledging: we can go downhill, but not up. Some quite distant places may be reachable, while others close by may not be, even if lower than us, because they would involve climbing again at some point. The following would implement this:
<p>

    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the next step via the overlooking relation from the location to the Sundial Plot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a room, say &quot;To sledge downhill to the Sundial, aim for [the way].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;It is not possible to sledge downhill to the Sundial.&quot;

<p>
<p>Another example would be the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; game, where it is claimed that any two people on Earth are connected by a sequence of up to six acquaintances. In an Inform implementation, we might talk about &quot;the next step via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein&quot;, for instance, a phrase likely to evaluate to Donald Rumsfeld, and then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of steps via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would be... but that would be telling.
<p>
<p>We can calculate the number of steps like this for any of the relations we have defined so far: it works exactly analogously to &quot;the number of moves from A to B&quot;, which reads the map. The same conventions apply: the result is 0 if the two things are the same, and -1 if there is no way to get from one to the other. (For &quot;any of the relations... so far&quot;, not &quot;for any relation&quot;: we are not able to calculate such things for relations which express conditions, as we shall see in the next section.)
<p>
<p>As with route-finding through the map, finding &quot;the next step via&quot; a relation can be slow. For instance, suppose we have dozens of articles of clothing all partially revealing each other, connected by two relations - overlying and underlying. Then &quot;the next step via&quot; these relations allows us to establish what can be worn on top of what else. If we need to calculate this often, and there are enormous wardrobes of clothes to choose from, speed starts to matter.
<p>
<p>Once again there is a choice of algorithms: &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;, where &quot;fast&quot; needs much more memory. To make route-finding for a given relation &quot;fast&quot;, we have to declare it that way:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Overlying relates various garments to various garments with fast route-finding.
<br>Overlapping relates various garments to each other with fast route-finding.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Otherwise, the &quot;slow&quot; method will be used.
<p>
<p>This &quot;with fast route-finding&quot; note can only be added to various-to-various relations. (Although route-finding through various-to-one and one-to-various relations is fully supported, it exploits the relative simplicity of these problems to use a more efficient algorithm than either &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;.)
<p>
<p>(- See Adjacent rooms and routes through the map for route-finding through the map rather than a relation.)
