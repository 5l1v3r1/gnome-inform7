<p>
<p>The viewpoint character may often need to remember events long past. The easiest way to do this is with a cut-scene, in which at some relevant point we pause the game and print a long passage of text describing the memory. Because large amounts of text can be hard for the player to take in, we may want to include some pauses in the presentation of this material; this facility is provided by the Basic Screen Effects extension by Emily Short, and might work something like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the photograph for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;This reminds you of the summer of '69...&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait for any key;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;... flashback content...&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait for any key.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;pause the game&quot; phrase in the same extension offers a more dramatic pause that also clears the screen before printing new text.
<p>
<p>Cut-scenes are easy to implement but should be used sparingly, since players often get impatient with long uninteractive passages. A slightly more deluxe implementation might insert an interactive scene that simply happens to be set in the past, before going on with another scene set &quot;now&quot;; and, indeed, some IF abandons the idea of &quot;now&quot; entirely, presenting pieces in a non-chronological order and letting the player work out how the sequence works together.
<p>
<p>The most challenging case to implement (though still not very hard) is the one where we remove the player from one scenario, let him play through a flashback with past possessions and clothing, and then restore him to the same situation he left, with all of the same possessions and clothing. <b>Pine 3</b> shows how to do this: the code to change the player's status is isolated at the end of the example, and might fruitfully be reused.  <b>Pine 4</b> expands on the same idea by adding another flashback scene, demonstrating one that can be visited repeatedly and one that can be seen only once.

"[if asleep]Sleeping Beauty lies here, oblivious to your presence[otherwise]Sleeping Beauty stands beside you, looking [attitude][end if]." The description is "She is even more magnificent than the rumors suggested." Understand "woman" or "girl" or "princess" or "lady" as Sleeping Beauty.\n\nDiscovery is a scene. Discovery begins when play begins. Discovery ends when Sleeping Beauty is awake. Marriage Proposal is a scene. Marriage Proposal begins when Discovery ends.\n\nWhen Discovery ends: say "Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken."; now Beauty is passive.\n\nInstead of waking an awake person: say "Redundant."\n\nInstead of waking an asleep person: say "Yes, but how?"\n\nInstead of attacking an asleep person:\nnow the noun is awake;\n\tsay "[The noun] sits bolt upright. \'Hey! Ow!\' So much for that true love\'s kiss nonsense."\n\nInstead of kissing an asleep person:\n\tnow the noun is awake;\n\tsay "[The noun] slowly stirs to wakefulness!"\n\nInstead of throwing water at an asleep person:\n\tnow the second noun is awake;\n\tremove the noun from play;\n\tsay "You pour out [the noun] on [the second noun].\n\n[The second noun] wakes, shuddering. \'Agh! I had a terrible dream about drowning and then-- Hey!\'"\n\nThe player carries a jug of water. Understand "pour [something] on [something]" or "splash [something] at/on [something]" as throwing it at.\n\nTable of Conversation\ntopic\treply\tquip\n"dream/dreams/nightmare/nightmares/sleep"\t"\'Sleep well?\' you ask solicitously.\n\n\'Not really,\' she replies, edging away from you.

I\'m seeing him, you see, and I think I\'ve been... sick... for a while, so he might be worried.\'\n\nYou try to think how to point out that it\'s been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend. And try not to think how awkward things would be in your family if she refuses to marry you."\n"marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover"\t"\'You\'ve been up here for a hundred years,\' you say. An unpleasant thought occurs to you. \'Was your young man in the castle somewhere?\'\n\nShe shakes her head mutely."\t"She goes to the window and looks out at the now-fading thicket of briar. \'That took a while to grow,\' she observes. \'I\'ve been up here longer than I thought.\'\n\nYou shrug, uncomfortable."\n\nInstead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Conversation:\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay "[reply entry][paragraph break]";\n\tblank out the whole row.\n\nInstead of telling an awake beauty about something: try asking the noun about it.\n\nInstead of asking an asleep person about something:\n\tsay "[The noun] snores."\n\nMarriage Proposal ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Conversation is 0.\n\nEvery turn during Marriage Proposal:\n\tif Beauty is active and Beauty is visible\n\tbegin;\n\t\trepeat through Table of Conversation\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tsay "[quip entry][paragraph break]";\n\t\t\tblank out the whole row;\n\t\t\tmake no decision;\n\t\tend repeat;\n\tend if.\n\nEvery turn: now Beauty is active.\n\nWhen Marriage Proposal ends: end the game saying "This is going to take some explaining."\n\n[So far we haven\'t much of a chance to affect matters and make them better. Suppose we\'d like to add an element to the conversation where we\'re allowed to tell Beauty about past events -- and explore them a bit; and if the first retelling doesn\'t go quite as planned, we\'re allowed to revisit these scenes to hit them with a bit more emphasis.]\n\nPart 2 - Flashbacks\n\nInstead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Flashback Material:\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay "[reply entry][paragraph break]".\n\nA fact is a kind of thing. The family circumstances is a fact. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be current or past.\n\n[Once known, a fact remains known permanently -- this could be useful if we wanted to make some rules about how Beauty acts when she knows different information. By contrast, a fact is only "current" if it is the last thing discussed. Since a player can mention a fact over and over, he can make it "current" again and again, and thus reactivate the flashback.]\n\nTable of Flashback Material\ntopic\treply\n"poor/poverty/family/money/mother/circumstances" or "family circumstances" or "my family/mother"\t"[if family circumstances is unknown]\'I wish you\'d give some thought to marrying me. You see,\' you say, your jaw tensing. \'I wouldn\'t ask if it weren\'t for my [family circumstances]...\'[otherwise]\'I don\'t think you fully understand the [family circumstances],\' you say.[end if]"\n\n After printing the name of a fact (called target): now the target is current; now the target is known.\n\n[This "After printing the name..." rule will be explained later in the chapter on activities; for now, it is enough to know that whenever family circumstances is mentioned in the table of flashback material, this rule will automatically be called. Now the terms under which the flashback happens:]\n\nPoverty flashback is a recurring scene. Poverty flashback begins when family circumstances is current. When poverty flashback begins: strip the player; move the player to the Woodcutter\'s Shack.\n\n[Note the "recurring" here: we want the player to be able to revisit this scene as needed.]\n\nThe Woodcutter\'s Shack is a room. "Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren\'t very well-boarded, and don\'t keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there\'s the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor."\n\nPigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is "They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what\'s worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there\'s less and less for them to forage on." Instead of smelling the pigs: say "They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse."; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.\n\nThe brothers are a man. The description of brothers is "Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother\'s health does not improve." Understand "brother" or "twin" or "twins" or "baby" or "franz" or "hans" or "lukas" as the brothers.\n\nThe untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is "She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn\'t been the same since your father left." On the bed is a folded letter.\n\nThe description of the letter is "Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium."\n\nInstead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:\n\tsay "You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.\n\n\'You\'ll find a way through this for us,\' she says, squeezing your fingers. \'I know you will.\'"; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.\n\nInstead of kissing Mother: say "You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes."\n\nInstead of waiting in the Shack: say "The wind blows sharply through the walls."\n\nInstead of attacking someone in the Shack:\n\tsay "Though sometimes the conditions of your life make you grouchy and impatient, you would never dream of striking a member of your own family. But from time to time you do feel the temptation."\n\nBeauty has a number called pity. After examining something in the Woodcutter\'s Shack, increase the pity of Beauty by 1. After examining mother, increase the pity of Beauty by 2. After examining the letter, increase the pity of Beauty by 3.\n\nPoverty flashback ends when waiting or the time since poverty flashback began is five minutes.\n\nWhen Poverty flashback ends:\n\tnow family circumstances is past;\n\tsay "...you finish describing the miserable circumstances of your home life, and allow your attention to return to the present.";\n\trestore the player;\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tif Beauty is sympathetic, say "\'Oh dear!\' she says. \'What a dreadful life!\' She wrings her hands. \'No wonder you are eager to improve your lot...! But --\' Her brow clears, a new thought occurring. \'You needn\'t marry me, you know! We could arrange it differently! I am certain that my father would give you a large reward, instead, and then I would not be separated from my current boyfriend!\'";\n\totherwise say "She makes a disgusted face, but she doesn\'t seem nearly so heart-wrung as you had hoped to make her. Tough audience, these modern princesses."\n\nDefinition: Beauty is sympathetic if the pity of Beauty is greater than 4.\n\nTo say attitude:\n\tif Beauty is sympathetic, say "distressed on your behalf";\n\totherwise say "a little confused".\n\n[And the following is the same as in the Space Patrol example as well: we need a systematic way to remove the player\'s possessions, then put everything back when the flashback is over:]\n\nSaved location is a room that varies. Locker is a container. Wardrobe is a container.\n\nTo strip the player:\n\t now every thing carried by the player is in the locker;\n\tnow every thing worn by the player is in the wardrobe;\n\tchange saved location to location.\n\nTo restore the player:\n\tnow every thing carried by the player is in the location;\n\tnow every thing in the locker is carried by the player;\n\tnow every thing in the wardrobe is worn by the player;\n\tmove the player to saved location.\n\nTest me with "x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / tell beauty about poverty / smell pigs / x mother / x letter / kiss mother / ask beauty about marriage / z / z".\n\n');

<p>
<p>So far we haven't much of a chance to affect matters and make them better. Suppose we'd like to add an element to the conversation where we're allowed to tell Beauty about past events -- and explore them a bit; and if the first retelling doesn't go quite as planned, we're allowed to revisit these scenes to hit them with a bit more emphasis.

<p>
<p>Once known, a fact remains known permanently -- this could be useful if we wanted to make some rules about how Beauty acts when she knows different information. By contrast, a fact is only &quot;current&quot; if it is the last thing discussed. Since a player can mention a fact over and over, he can make it &quot;current&quot; again and again, and thus reactivate the flashback.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After printing the name of a fact (called target): now the target is current; now the target is known.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This &quot;After printing the name...&quot; rule will be explained later in the chapter on activities; for now, it is enough to know that whenever family circumstances is mentioned in the table of flashback material, this rule will automatically be called. Now the terms under which the flashback happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Poverty flashback is a recurring scene. Poverty flashback begins when family circumstances is current. When poverty flashback begins: strip the player; move the player to the Woodcutter's Shack.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the &quot;recurring&quot; here: we want the player to be able to revisit this scene as needed.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Woodcutter's Shack is a room. &quot;Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren't very well-boarded, and don't keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there's the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is &quot;They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what's worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there's less and less for them to forage on.&quot; Instead of smelling the pigs: say &quot;They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.&quot;; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The brothers are a man. The description of brothers is &quot;Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother's health does not improve.&quot; Understand &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;twin&quot; or &quot;twins&quot; or &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;franz&quot; or &quot;hans&quot; or &quot;lukas&quot; as the brothers.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is &quot;She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn't been the same since your father left.&quot; On the bed is a folded letter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the letter is &quot;Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'You'll find a way through this for us,' she says, squeezing your fingers. 'I know you will.'&quot;; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing Mother: say &quot;You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting in the Shack: say &quot;The wind blows sharply through the walls.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking someone in the Shack:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Though sometimes the conditions of your life make you grouchy and impatient, you would never dream of striking a member of your own family. But from time to time you do feel the temptation.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Beauty has a number called pity. After examining something in the Woodcutter's Shack, increase the pity of Beauty by 1. After examining mother, increase the pity of Beauty by 2. After examining the letter, increase the pity of Beauty by 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Poverty flashback ends when waiting or the time since poverty flashback began is five minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Poverty flashback ends:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now family circumstances is past;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;...you finish describing the miserable circumstances of your home life, and allow your attention to return to the present.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restore the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Beauty is passive;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is sympathetic, say &quot;'Oh dear!' she says. 'What a dreadful life!' She wrings her hands. 'No wonder you are eager to improve your lot...! But --' Her brow clears, a new thought occurring. 'You needn't marry me, you know! We could arrange it differently! I am certain that my father would give you a large reward, instead, and then I would not be separated from my current boyfriend!'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;She makes a disgusted face, but she doesn't seem nearly so heart-wrung as you had hoped to make her. Tough audience, these modern princesses.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: Beauty is sympathetic if the pity of Beauty is greater than 4.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say attitude:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is sympathetic, say &quot;distressed on your behalf&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;a little confused&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And the following is the same as in the Space Patrol example as well: we need a systematic way to remove the player's possessions, then put everything back when the flashback is over:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Saved location is a room that varies. Locker is a container. Wardrobe is a container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To strip the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now every thing carried by the player is in the locker;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing worn by the player is in the wardrobe;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change saved location to location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To restore the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing carried by the player is in the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing in the locker is carried by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing in the wardrobe is worn by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the player to saved location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / tell beauty about poverty / smell pigs / x mother / x letter / kiss mother / ask beauty about marriage / z / z&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because we haven't changed the endings of the &quot;Marriage Proposal&quot; scene, there is still only one way for this scenario to work out; but at least now the player has the opportunity to alter Beauty's attitude a bit (or not) before the game is done.
