<p>
<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied, unless we give specific instructions for that.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and place a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the alternative blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the &quot;alternative blossom rule&quot; is a named rule in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook.

<p>
<p>As it happens, correct behavior is built into the GIVE command once &quot;block giving&quot; is turned off, so we do not have to write a replacement report or carry-out rule; the object will be transferred to the possession of the caterpillar. But we do want to adjust the action just a little so that our gift cheers up the recipient:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out giving (this is the gratitude for gifts rule): improve the mood of the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mood is a kind of value. The moods are hostile, suspicious, indifferent, friendly, and adoring. An animal has a mood. An animal is usually indifferent.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To improve the mood of (character - an animal):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mood of character is less than friendly, change the mood of the character to the mood after the mood of the character.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now whenever we give something to an animal, the animal will be pleased about the present. Of course, we might also want to add a check rule to giving, to see whether the offering is something the recipient really wants:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check giving (this is the polite refusal of unwanted objects rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the noun interests the second noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] disdainfully refuses [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide whether (item - a thing) interests (character - a person):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character has the item, no;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is edible, yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something to someone:
<br>try giving the noun to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There is already a perfectly workable report rule that will describe what happens when we give something to someone, but let's say we want to report on the recipient's changed mood, too:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After giving something to someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You give [the noun] to [the second noun], who appears mollified and is now merely [mood of the second noun].&quot;
