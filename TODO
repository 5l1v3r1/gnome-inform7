BUGS
- extensions of Glulx blorb release files should be .gblorb, not .zblorb.
- use libxml2 as it ought to be used
- get glulx compiling to work (new version of Inform 6??)
- If files (as in, part of the .inform package spec) are missing when loading, create default ones
- is_valid_extension does crappy things with strings
- cblorb does not work with files with backslashes in their names (compile.c:376)
- perhaps the recent manager is a little strange?
- warnings when creating the main window and the game tab
- nested comments are not highlighted
