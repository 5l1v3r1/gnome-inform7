BUGS
- invalid pointer access when adding label to skein?
- Fix crooked lines in Skein layout
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
- why "Page 7" is displayed in the right-click menu of the Index notebook,
  instead of "World" and "Page 8" on the main window (bug in GtkNotebook?)
