TO DO
- Testing

- Progress bar when compiling

FOLLOWING RELEASES
- Do the Glade3, libglade, GtkAssistant, and libsexy (0.3)
- Embedded interpreters (0.3)
- Skein, Transcript (0.4)
    File/Import into Skein...
    Transcript/etc.
    Build/Play All Blessed
- I6 projects, debug tools (?)
- Printing (after GtkSourceView is updated to use GtkPrint)

Low priority
- A real RTF parser / text converter

BUGS
- warnings when creating the main window and the game tab
- warning when pressing the Release toolbutton
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- nested comments are not highlighted (limitation of GtkSourceView)
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
