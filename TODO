  the compiler does

FOLLOWING RELEASES
- Write a new Glk library

    Transcript/etc.
    Build/Play All Blessed
- I6 Projects
- Debug tools (?)
- GtkAssistant (when debian backport of GTK 2.12 is available) - "activate 
  default" properties of GtkEntries

BUGS THAT I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT
- warnings when creating the main window
- warning when pressing the Release toolbutton
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
- why "Page 7" is displayed in the right-click menu of the Index notebook,
  instead of "World" and "Page 8" on the main window (bug in GtkNotebook?)
