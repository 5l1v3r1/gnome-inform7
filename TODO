BUGS THAT I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT
- warnings when creating the main window
- warning when pressing the Release toolbutton
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
- why "Page 7" is displayed in the right-click menu of the Index notebook,
  instead of "World" and "Page 8" on the main window (bug in GtkNotebook?)
