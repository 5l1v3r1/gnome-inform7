BUGS
- warnings when creating the main window and the game tab
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- nested comments are not highlighted (limitation of GtkSourceView)
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
- Glulx compiling doesn't work (bug in Linux port of Inform 6??)
- cblorb doesn't work with files with backslashes in their names (compile.c:376)
