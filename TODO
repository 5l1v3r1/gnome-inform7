TO DO
- Check everything for correct use of UTF8 encoding
- Implement trimming relative to temporary score of nodes
- Menu item: File/Import into Skein...
- add watch on the extensions directory and call populate_extension_lists when
  something changes; also run census -> GIO has to be in Debian
- redraw skein immediately when font size changes
- width of skein bubbles needs to be calculated from text, taking font size into
  account
- implement reading contents html file generated by compiler when intelligent
  index inspector is turned off
- Save last location for putting release file and open release dialog there
- Automatic backup?
- Rethink preference for spell checking. Global for all windows or not?
- Write a new Glk library
- Capture text from interpreter
- Runtime error detection
- Transcript
    Transcript/etc.
    Build/Play All Blessed
- I6 Projects
- Debug tools (?)
- GtkAssistant (when debian backport of GTK 2.12 is available) - "activate 
  default" properties of GtkEntries
- Printing
- migrate from Glade to GtkBuilder (ditto)

BUGS
- invalid pointer access when adding label to skein?
- Fix crooked lines in Skein layout
BUGS THAT I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT
- warnings when creating the main window
- warning when pressing the Release toolbutton
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
- why "Page 7" is displayed in the right-click menu of the Index notebook,
  instead of "World" and "Page 8" on the main window (bug in GtkNotebook?)
