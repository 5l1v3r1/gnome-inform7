TO DO
- Back/forward buttons

FOLLOWING RELEASES
- GtkAssistant (when debian starts using GTK 2.10)
- I6 Projects
- Embedded interpreters (0.5)
- Skein, Transcript (0.6)
    File/Import into Skein...
    Transcript/etc.
    Build/Play All Blessed
- Glade3/Libglade
- Debug tools (?)
- Printing (after GtkSourceView is updated to use GtkPrint)

BUGS THAT I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT
- warnings when creating the main window and the game tab
- warning when pressing the Release toolbutton
- why frotz can't find the game file on Debian-like systems
BUGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT
- nested comments are not highlighted (limitation of GtkSourceView)
- Bug in GtkSpell: When detaching the GtkSpell from the second Source view, it
  still thinks it has to remove the misspelling marks. This generates errors.
