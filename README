This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design
by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the files AUTHORS and THANKS for more
information on other contributors.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The GNOME Inform 7 source code distribution does not include any
binaries. If you compile GNOME Inform 7 from source, you will need to download 
the Linux command-line package appropriate for your processor from 
<http://inform7.com> and put the `ni' file in the directory src/ni' before doing 
`./configure'.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are upgrading from version 5J39 or earlier, and 
you are having problems with extensions, you may have to delete your ~/Inform
directory and reinstall your extensions.
