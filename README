This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design
by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more information on
other contributors.

This release introduces several improvements, most notably the inclusion of an
up-to-date Glulx interpreter and Inform 6 compiler. Work continues on porting
the Skein. It is not visible to the user yet, although an enterprising source
hacker should be able to unhide it fairly easily. Still, there should be a build
soon with a working Skein, and a Transcript will follow soon after. Please help
me by reporting bugs to philip.chimento@gmail.com.

IMPORTANT NOTE: From version 5G67 onward, the GNOME Inform 7 source package will
not include the compiler binaries anymore. If you compile GNOME Inform 7 from
source, you will need to download the appropriate package from 
www.inform-fiction.org</a> and put the appropriate versions of `ni',  
`inform-6.31-biplatform', and `cBlorb' in the directory 
`gnome-inform7/data/Compilers' before doing `make install'. This is in the
interests of having a truly platform-independent source package, and also of
shaving a few megabytes off the size of the source package. The Fedora and
Ubuntu packages will continue to include binaries.

Known bugs:
* The syntax highlighting doesn't work quite the same way as in the OS X and
  Windows versions; the recent release of GtkSourceView 2.0 should mean that
  this will be fixed in the not-too-distant future.
* On the Installed Extensions page, all the extensions will be listed as
  overridden by a locally installed version. This is a limitation of the
  compiler.
* The Glulx interpreter on the Game tab may be up to date, but the Glk library
  is not. It cannot handle color text or the more esoteric Unicode characters.
  Some features, such as Simple Graphical Window, will cause a crash.
