This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design
by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more information on
other contributors.

This release sees the debut of the long-awaited Skein. It is as yet without an
accompanying Transcript. The Glulx interpreter has also been updated, and the 
problems with syntax highlighting should be fixed now. Please help me by 
reporting bugs to philip.chimento@gmail.com.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are upgrading from version 5J39 or earlier, and you are
having problems with extensions, you may have to delete your ~/Inform directory
and reinstall your extensions.

IMPORTANT NOTE: From version 5G67 onward, the GNOME Inform 7 source package will
not include the compiler binaries anymore. If you compile GNOME Inform 7 from
source, you will need to download the appropriate package from 
www.inform-fiction.org</a> and put the appropriate versions of `ni',  
`inform-6.31-biplatform', and `cBlorb' in the directory 
`gnome-inform7/data/Compilers' before doing `make install'. This is in the
interests of having a truly platform-independent source package, and also of
shaving a few megabytes off the size of the source package. The Fedora and
Ubuntu packages will continue to include binaries.

Known bugs:
* The Glulx interpreter on the Game tab may be up to date, but the Glk library
  is not. It cannot handle color text or the more esoteric Unicode characters.
  Some features, such as Simple Graphical Window, will cause a crash.
* If two projects are open, they cannot both be playing their game in the Game
  tab at the same time.
