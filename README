This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a
design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more
information on other contributors.

Starting with this November 2007 release of Build 5F63, GNOME Inform 7 now
follows the official Inform 7 release schedule and is available from the
downloads page at www.inform-fiction.org. Several bugs have been fixed, but
most of the effort between the last release and this one has gone into 
porting the Skein. It is not visible to the user yet, although an 
enterprising source hacker should be able to unhide it fairly easily. Still,
there should be a build soon with a working Skein, and a Transcript will
follow soon after. Please help me by reporting bugs to
philip.chimento@gmail.com.

IMPORTANT NOTE: From this version onward, the GNOME Inform 7 source package
will not include the compiler binaries anymore. If you compile GNOME 
Inform 7 from source, you will need to download the appropriate package from
www.inform-fiction.org and put the appropriate versions of `ni', 
`inform-6.31-biplatform', and `cBlorb' in the directory
`gnome-inform7/data/Compilers' before doing `make install'. This is in the
interests of having a truly platform-independent source package, and also of
shaving a few megabytes off the size of the source package. The Fedora and
Ubuntu packages will continue to include binaries.

Known bugs:
* The syntax highlighting doesn't work quite the same way as in the OS X and
  Windows versions; the recent release of GtkSourceView 2.0 should mean that
  this will be fixed in the not-too-distant future.
* On the Installed Extensions page, all the extensions will be listed as
  overridden by a locally installed version. This is a limitation of the
  compiler.
* The interpreter on the Game tab does not handle color text or the more
  esoteric Unicode characters. Some Glulx features will cause a crash.
