(IMPORTANT NOTE: To run this program, you must install your own interpreters.
You need to have binaries named "frotz" and "glulxe" in your path, otherwise
the IDE will not start. This is temporary, because in a later version the code
for the interpreters will be incorporated into the program itself.)

This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design
by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. Much of the code was borrowed from Andrew
Hunter's Mac OS X version and David Kinder's Windows version. 

Version 0.1 of GNOME Inform 7 is the first release of this program. I wrote it
mainly because I wanted a front end for Inform 7 that would run on Fedora Core.
Also, it was a good excuse to learn GTK+. I expect this version will be full of
bugs; please help me by reporting them to <philip.chimento@gmail.com>. Also,
there are some shortcomings which I suppose don't count as bugs, as I am aware
of them and have left them to be addressed in a subsequent version: 

* There is no Skein and no Transcript.
* There is no Inspector window.
* You cannot search the documentation.
* Not all of the settings in the Preferences window work; the ones that don't
  are grayed out.
* The syntax highlighting doesn't work quite the same way as in the OS X and
  Windows versions; I found it useful to highlight `if', `otherwise', `begin'
  and `end if' in another color. Also, GtkSourceView doesn't support
  highlighting patterns (such as [...]) differently according to context (such
  as within or without double quotes), so text within square brackets is
  displayed as a comment when it is outside of quotes, and as normal text when
  it is within quotes.
* Glulx compiling doesn't seem to work. However, neither did it when I used
  only the command line tools, so I assume it's caused by running the Natural
  Inform compiler under Wine.
