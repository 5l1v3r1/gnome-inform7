This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a
design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the file AUTHORS for more
information on other contributors.

Version 0.4 of GNOME Inform 7 was released in August 2007, updating the
compiler to version 4W37 and featuring a completely new embedded Gargoyle
interpreter in the Game tab. GNOME Inform 7 started in August 2006 when I
started designing the user interface purely to kill some time. By now, most
features from the official Inform 7 version, except for the Skein and
Transcript, are included. Please help me by reporting bugs to
philip.chimento@gmail.com.

Also, there are some shortcomings which I suppose don't count as bugs, as I
am aware of them and have left them to be addressed in a subsequent version
(or not at all):

* There is no Skein and no Transcript. (I hope to have ported at least the
  Skein by version 0.5.)
* The Replay command therefore doesn't replay through the skein; it just
  repeats the commands from the last time the game was played.
* The syntax highlighting doesn't work quite the same way as in the OS X
  and Windows versions; I found it useful to highlight `if', `otherwise',
  `begin' and `end if' in another color. Also, nested comments are not
  highlighted correctly; this is a limitation of GtkSourceView.
* On the Installed Extensions page, all the extensions will be listed as
  overridden by a locally installed version. This is a limitation of the
  compiler.
