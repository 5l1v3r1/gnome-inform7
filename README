This GNOME version of Inform 7 was created by P.F. Chimento, based on a design
by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter. See the files AUTHORS and THANKS for more
information on other contributors.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The GNOME Inform 7 source code distribution does not include any
binaries. If you compile GNOME Inform 7 from source, you will need to download 
the Linux command-line package appropriate for your processor from 
www.inform-fiction.org and put the `ni' file in the directory 
`gnome-inform7/src/ni' before doing `./configure'.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are upgrading from version 5J39 or earlier, and 
you are having problems with extensions, you may have to delete your ~/Inform
directory and reinstall your extensions.

To report bugs:
If the bug is in the interface, the fastest way to report it is to e-mail it to
me at philip.chimento@gmail.com. Other bugs, e.g. if your story is not compiling
correctly, should be reported to Graham Nelson, the author of Inform. Point your
