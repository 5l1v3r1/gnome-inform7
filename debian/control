Description: Inform 7 interactive fiction programming language
 Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language.
 It is a radical reinvention of the way interactive fiction is designed,
 guided by contemporary work in semantics and by the practical experience of
 some of the world's best-known writers of IF.
