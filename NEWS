Version 0.2:

+ Now runs Build 3Z95 of the Natural Inform compiler.
+ The width of the tab stops can be set in the Preferences window.
* Added a Rebuild Index command instead of the Compile command, which
  compiles the game without running it and displays the index tab, as in
  the new Mac OS X version.
- Removed the Play command, which played a user-selected game file in the
  game tab.
* Changed some of the menus and keyboard shortcuts to be more like the Mac
  OS X version.
